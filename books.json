    "description": "<p>In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence - when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.  </p>\n<p>Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, <em>1776</em> is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.  </p>\n<p>At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.  </p>\n<p>But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's <em>1776</em> is another landmark in the literature of American history.</p>",

Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written. </p>\n<h3>Review</h3>\n<p>Novel by George Orwell, published in 1949 as a warning about the menaces of totalitarianism. The novel is set in an imaginary future world that is dominated by three perpetually warring totalitarian police states. The book's hero, Winston Smith, is a minor party functionary in one of these states. His longing for truth and decency leads him to secretly rebel against the government. Smith has a love affair with a like-minded woman, but they are both arrested by the Thought Police. The ensuing imprisonment, torture, and reeducation of Smith are intended not merely to break him physically or make him submit but to root out his independent mental existence and his spiritual dignity. Orwell's warning of the dangers of totalitarianism made a deep impression on his contemporaries and upon subsequent readers, and the book's title and many of its coinages, such as NEWSPEAK, became bywords for modern political abuses. -- <em>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</em></p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p>1Q84 (いちきゅうはちよん, Ichi-Kyū-Hachi-Yon, stylized in the Japanese cover as \"ichi-kew-hachi-yon\") is a novel written by Japanese writer Haruki Murakami, first published in three volumes in Japan in 2009–10.[1] It covers a fictionalized year of 1984 in parallel with a \"real\" one. The novel is a story of how a woman named Aomame begins to notice strange changes occurring in the world. She is quickly caught up in a plot involving Sakigake, a religious cult, and her childhood love, Tengo, and embarks on a journey to discover what is \"real\".</p>\n<p>_____</p>\n<p>“Murakami is like a magician who explains what he’s doing as he performs the trick and still makes you believe he has supernatural powers . . . But while anyone can tell a story that resembles a dream, it's the rare artist, like this one, who can make us feel that we are dreaming it ourselves.” — <em>The New York Times Book Review</em></p>\n<p><br>**<br></p>\n<p>The year is 1984 and the city is Tokyo. </p>\n<p>A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver’s enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 —“Q is for ‘question mark.’ A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. </p>\n<p>As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector. </p>\n<p>A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s— <em>1Q84</em> is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.</p></div>",

She is overjoyed to be given a more creative assignment, to design a tapestry for an exhibition to celebrate the centenary of women's suffrage in Norway, but soon finds that it is a much more daunting task than she had anticipated. <br><br>Meanwhile, a Polish family moves into her apartment, and their activities become a challenge to her unconscious assumptions and her self-image as a good feminist and an open-minded liberal. Is it possible to reconcile the desire to be tolerant and altruistic with the imperative need for creative and personal space?<br><br>______<br><br>Original title: Et norsk hus © Cappelen Damm AS, 2014.

    "description": "<div>\n<p>Brace yourself for the most astonishing, challenging, upsetting, and profoundly moving book in many a season. An epic about love and friendship in the twenty-first century that goes into some of the darkest places fiction has ever traveled and yet somehow improbably breaks through into the light. Truly an amazement — and a great gift for its publisher. When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity. Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome — but that will define his life forever. In rich and resplendent prose, Yanagihara has fashioned a tragic and transcendent hymn to brotherly love, a masterful depiction of heartbreak, and a dark examination of the tyranny of memory and the limits of human endurance.</p></div>",

The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to.

Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.</p>",

Seeing herpale and sweating with pain had been hard, but the halo symptoms that led intoit had almost been worse. She'd be cleaning the house or working throughcontracts for her law practice and then her left hand would start to clench,curling against itself until the veins and tendons seemed to creak with thestrain. Next her eyes lost their focus, pupils dilating until her blue eyes hadgone black. It was like watching someone having a seizure, and he always thought <em>this</em> time, she'd die from it.</p>\n<p>He'd been six at the time, and he'd never told any of his parents how much themigraines unnerved him, or how much he dreaded them, even when things seemedgood. The fear had become familiar. Almost expected. It should have taken theedge off the terror, and maybe it did, but what replaced it was a sense of beingtrapped. The assault could come at any time, and it could not be avoided.</p>\n<p>It poisoned everything, even if it was only a little bit.</p>\n<p>It felt like being haunted.</p>\n<p>\"The house always wins,\" Holden shouted.</p>\n<p>He and the crew—Alex, Amos, Naomi—sat at a private table in the VIP lounge ofCeres' most expensive hotel. Even there, the bells, whistles, and digitizedvoices of the slot machines were loud enough to drown out most casualconversation. The few frequencies they weren't dominating were neatly filled inby the high-pitched clatter of the pachinko machines and the low bass rumble ofa band playing on one of the casino's three stages. All of it added up to a wallof sound that left Holden's guts vibrating and his ears ringing.</p>\n<p>\"What?\" Amos yelled back at him.</p>\n<p>\"In the end, the house always wins!\"</p>\n<p>Amos stared down at an enormous pile of chips in front of him. He and Alex werecounting and dividing them in preparation for their next foray out to the gamingtables. At a glance, Holden guessed they'd won something like fifteen thousandCeres new yen in just the last hour. It made an impressive stack. If they couldquit now, they'd be ahead. But, of course, they wouldn't quit now.</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" Amos said. \"What?\"</p>\n<p>Holden smiled and shrugged. \"Nothing.\"</p>\n<p>If his crew wanted to lose a few thousand bucks blowing off steam at theblackjack tables, who was he to interfere? The truth was it wouldn't even put adent in the payout from their most recent contract, and that was only one ofthree contracts they'd completed in the last four months. It was going to be avery flush year.</p>\n<p>Holden had made a lot of mistakes over the last three years. Deciding to quithis job as the OPA's bagman and become an independent contractor wasn't one ofthem. In the months since he'd put up his shingle as a freelance courier andescort ship, the <em>Rocinante</em> had taken seven jobs, and all of them hadbeen profitable. They'd spent money refitting the ship bow to stern. She'd had atough couple of years, and she'd needed some love.</p>\n<p>When that was done and they still had more money in their general account thanthey knew what to do with, Holden had asked for a crew wish list. Naomi had paidto have a bulkhead in their quarters cut out to join the two rooms. They now hada bed large enough for two people and plenty of room to walk around it. Alex hadpointed out the difficulty in buying new military-grade torpedoes for the ship,and had requested a keel-mounted rail gun for the <em>Roci</em>. It would givethem more punch than the point defense cannons, and its only ammunitionrequirements were two-pound tungsten slugs. Amos had spent thirty grand during astopover on Callisto, buying them some after-market engine upgrades. When Holdenpointed out that the <em>Roci</em> was already capable of accelerating fastenough to kill her crew and asked why they'd need to upgrade her, Amos hadreplied, \"Because this shit is awesome.\" Holden had just nodded and smiled andpaid the bill.</p>\n<p>Even after the initial giddy rush of spending, they had enough to pay themselvessalaries that were five times what they'd made on the <em>Canterbury</em> andkeep the ship in water, air, and fuel pellets for the next decade.</p>\n<p>Probably, it was temporary. There would be dry times too when no work came theirway and they'd have to economize and make do. That just wasn't today.</p>\n<p>Amos and Alex had finished counting their chips and were shouting to Naomi aboutthe finer points of blackjack, trying to get her to join them at the tables.Holden waved at the waiter, who darted over to take his order. No ordering froma table screen here in the VIP lounge.</p>\n<p>\"What do you have in a scotch that came from actual grain?\" Holden asked.</p>\n<p>\"We have several Ganymede distillations,\" the waiter said. He'd learned thetrick of being heard over the racket without straining. He smiled at Holden.\"But for the discriminating gentleman from Earth, we also have a few bottles ofsixteen-year Lagavulin we keep aside.\"</p>\n<p>\"You mean, like, actual scotch from Scotland?\"</p>\n<p>\"From the island of Islay, to be precise,\" the waiter replied. \"It's twelvehundred a bottle.\"</p>\n<p>\"I want that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes sir, and four glasses.\" The waiter tipped his head and headed off to thebar.</p>\n<p>\"We're going to play blackjack now,\" Naomi said, laughing. Amos was pulling astack of chips out of his tray and pushing them across the table to her. \"Wantto come?\"</p>\n<p>The band in the next room stopped playing, and the background noise dropped toan almost tolerable level for a few seconds before someone started piping Muzakacross the casino PA.</p>\n<p>\"Guys, wait a few minutes,\" Holden said. \"I've bought a bottle of somethingnice, and I want to have one last toast before we go our separate ways for thenight.\"</p>\n<p>Amos looked impatient right up until the bottle arrived, and then spent severalseconds cooing over the label. \"Yeah, okay, this was worth waiting for.\"</p>\n<p>Holden poured out a shot for each of them, then held his glass up. \"To the bestship and crew anyone has ever had the privilege of serving with, and to gettingpaid.\"</p>\n<p>\"To getting paid!\" Amos echoed, and then the shots disappeared.</p>\n<p>\"God damn, Cap,\" Alex said, then picked up the bottle to look it over. \"Can weput some of this on the <em>Roci</em>? You can take it out of my salary.\"</p>\n<p>\"Seconded,\" Naomi said, then took the bottle and poured out four more shots.</p>\n<p>For a few minutes, the stacks of chips and the lure of the card tables wereforgotten. Which was all Holden had wanted. Just to keep these people togetherfor a few moments longer. On every other ship he'd ever served on, hitting portwas a chance to get away from the same faces for a few days. Not anymore. Notwith this crew. He stifled an urge to say a maudlin, <em>I love you guys!</em> bydrinking another shot of scotch.</p>\n<p>\"One last hit for the road,\" Amos said, picking up the bottle.</p>\n<p>\"Gonna hit the head,\" Holden replied, and pushed away from the table. He weaveda bit more than he expected on his walk to the restroom. The scotch had gone tohis brain fast.</p>\n<p>The restrooms in the VIP lounge were lush. No rows of urinals and sinks here.Instead, half a dozen doors that led to private facilities with their own toiletand sink. Holden pushed his way into one and latched it behind him. The noiselevel dropped almost to nothing as soon as the door closed. A little likestepping outside the world. It was probably designed that way. He was gladwhoever built the casino had allowed for a place of relative calm. He wouldn'thave been shocked to see a slot machine over the sink.</p>\n<p>He put one hand on the wall to steady himself while he did his business. He wasmid-stream when the room brightened for a moment and the chrome handle on thetoilet reflected a faint blue light. The fear hit him in the gut.</p>\n<p>Again.</p>\n<p>\"I swear to God,\" Holden said, pausing to finish and then zip up. \"Miller, youbetter not be there when I turn around.\"</p>\n<p>He turned around.</p>\n<p>Miller was there.</p>\n<p>\"Hey,\" the dead man started.</p>\n<p>\"'We need to talk,'\" Holden finished for him, then walked to the sink to washhis hands. A tiny blue firefly followed him and landed on the counter. Holdensmashed it with his palm, but when he lifted his hand nothing was there.</p>\n<p>In the mirror, Miller's reflection shrugged. When he moved, it was with asickening jerkiness, like a clockwork ticking through its motions. Human andinhuman both.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone's here at once,\" the dead man said. \"I don't want to talk about whathappened to Julie.\"</p>\n<p>Holden pulled a towel out of the basket next to the sink, then leaned againstthe counter facing Miller and slowly dried his hands. He was trembling, the sameas he always did. The sense of threat and evil was crawling up his spine, justthe same way it always did. Holden hated it.</p>\n<p>Detective Miller smiled, distracted by something Holden couldn't see.</p>\n<p>The man had worked security on Ceres, been fired, and gone off hunting on hisown, searching for a missing girl. He'd saved Holden's life once. Holden hadwatched when the asteroid station Miller and thousands of victims of the alienprotomolecule had been trapped on crashed into Venus. Including Julie Mao, thegirl Miller had searched for and then found too late. For a year, the alienartifact had suffered and worked its incomprehensible design under the clouds ofVenus. When it rose, hauling massive structures up from the depths and flyingout past the orbit of Neptune like some titanic sea creature translated to thevoid, Miller rose with it.</p>\n<p>And now everything he said was madness.</p>\n<p>\"Holden,\" Miller said, not talking to him. Describing him. \"Yeah, that makessense. You're not one of them. Hey, you have to listen to me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then you have to say something. This shit is out of hand. You've been doingyour random appearing act for almost a year now, and you've never said even onething that made sense. Not one.\"</p>\n<p>Miller waved the comment away. The old man was starting to breathe faster,panting like he'd run a race. Beads of sweat glistened on his pale, gray-tingedskin.</p>\n<p>\"So there was this unlicensed brothel down in sector eighteen. We went inthinking we'd have fifteen, twenty in the box. More, maybe. Got there, and theplace was stripped to the stone. I'm supposed to think about that. It meanssomething.\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you want from me?\" Holden said. \"Just tell me what you <em>want</em> ,all right?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not crazy,\" Miller said. \"When I'm crazy, they kill me. God, did they killme?\" Miller's mouth formed a small O, and he began to suck air in. His lips weredarkening, the blood under the skin turning black. He put a hand on Holden'sshoulder, and it felt too heavy. Too solid. Like Miller had been remade withiron instead of bones. \"It's all gone pear-shaped. We got there, but it's empty.The whole sky's empty.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know what that means.\"</p>\n<p>Miller leaned close. His breath smelled like acetate fumes. His eyes locked onHolden, eyebrows raised, asking him if he understood.</p>\n<p>\"You've got to help me,\" Miller said. The blood vessels in his eyes were almostblack. \"They know I find things. They know you help me.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're dead,\" Holden said, the words coming out of him without consideration orplanning.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone's dead,\" Miller said. He took his hand from Holden's shoulder andturned away. Confusion troubled his brow. \"Almost. Almost.\"</p>\n<p>Holden's terminal buzzed at him, and he took it out of his pocket. Naomi hadsent DID YOU FALL IN? Holden began typing out a reply, then stopped when herealized he'd have no idea what to say.</p>\n<p>When Miller spoke, his voice was small, almost childlike with wonder andamazement.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck. It <em>happened</em> ,\" Miller said.</p>\n<p>\"What happened?\" Holden said.</p>\n<p>A door banged as someone else went into a neighboring stall, and Miller wasgone. The smell of ozone and some rich organic volatiles like a spice shop gonerancid were all the evidence that he had been there. And that might only havebeen in Holden's imagination.</p>\n<p>Holden stood for a moment, waiting for the coppery taste to leave his mouth.Waiting for his heartbeat to slow back down to normal. Doing what he always didin the aftermath. When the worst had passed, he rinsed his face with cold waterand dried it with a soft towel. The distant, muffled sound of the gambling decksrose to a frenzy. A jackpot.</p>\n<p>He wouldn't tell them. Naomi, Alex, Amos. They deserved to have their pleasurewithout the thing that had been Miller intruding on it. Holden recognized thatthe impulse to keep it from them was irrational, but it felt so powerfully likeprotecting them that he didn't question it much. Whatever Miller had become,Holden was going to stand between it and the <em>Roci</em>.</p>\n<p>He studied his reflection until it was perfect. The carefree, slightly drunkcaptain of a successful independent ship on shore leave. Easy. Happy. He wentback out to the pandemonium of the casino.</p>\n<p>For a moment, it was like stepping back in time. The casinos on Eros. The deathbox. The lights felt a little too bright, the noises sounded a little too loud.Holden made his way back to the table and poured himself another shot. He couldnurse this one for a while. He'd enjoy the flavor and the night. Someone behindhim shrieked their laughter. Only laughter.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Naomi appeared, stepping out of the bustle and chaos likeserenity in a female form. The half-drunken, expansive love he'd felt earliercame back as he watched her make her way toward him. They'd shipped together onthe <em>Canterbury</em> for years before he'd found himself falling in love withher. Looking back, every morning he'd woken up with someone else had been a lostopportunity to breathe Naomi's air. He couldn't imagine what he'd been thinking.He shifted to the side, making room for her.</p>\n<p>\"They cleaned you out?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"Alex,\" she said. \"They cleaned Alex out. I gave him my chips.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are a woman of tremendous generosity,\" he said with a grin.</p>\n<p>Naomi's dark eyes softened into a sympathetic expression.</p>\n<p>\"Miller showed up again?\" she asked, leaning close to be heard over the noise.</p>\n<p>\"It's a little unsettling how easily you see through me.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're pretty legible. And this wouldn't be Miller's first bathroom ambush. Didhe make any more sense this time?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" Holden said. \"He's like talking to an electrical problem. Half the timeI'm not sure he even knows I'm there.\"</p>\n<p>\"It can't really be Miller, can it?\"</p>\n<p>\"If it's the protomolecule wearing a Miller suit, I think that's actuallycreepier.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fair point,\" Naomi said. \"Did he say anything new, at least?\"</p>\n<p>\"A little bit, maybe. He said something happened.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know. He just said, 'It happened,' and blinked out.\"</p>\n<p>They sat together for a few minutes, a private silence within the riot, herfingers interlaced with his. She leaned over, kissing his right eyebrow, andthen pulled him up off the chair.</p>\n<p>\"Come on,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Where are we going?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to teach you how to play poker,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"I know how to play poker.\"</p>\n<p>\"You think you do,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Are you calling me a fish?\"</p>\n<p>She smiled and tugged at him.</p>\n<p>Holden shook his head. \"If you want to, let's go back to the ship. We can get afew people together and have a private game. It doesn't make sense to do ithere. The house always wins.\"</p>\n<p>\"We aren't here to win,\" Naomi said, and the seriousness in her voice made thewords carry more than the obvious meaning. \"We're here to play.\"</p>\n<p>The news came two days later.</p>\n<p>Holden was in the galley, eating takeout from one of the dockside restaurants:garlic sauce over rice, three kinds of legumes, and something so similar tochicken, it might as well have been the real thing. Amos and Naomi wereoverseeing the loading of nutrients and filters for the air recycling systems.Alex, in the pilot's seat, was asleep. On the other ships Holden had servedaboard, having the full crew back on ship before departure required it wasalmost unheard of, and they'd all spent a couple of nights in dockside hotelsbefore they'd come home. But they were home now.</p>\n<p>Holden ran through the local feeds on his hand terminal, sipping news andentertainment from throughout the system. A security flaw in the new BandaoSolice game meant that financial and personal information from six millionpeople had been captured on a pirate server orbiting Titan. Martian militaryexperts were calling for increased spending to address the losses suffered inthe battle around Ganymede. On Earth, an African farming coalition was defyingthe ban on a nitrogen-fixing strain of bacteria. Protesters on both sides of theissue were taking to the streets in Cairo.</p>\n<p>Holden was flipping back and forth, letting his mind float on the surface of theinformation, when a red band appeared on one of the newsfeeds. And then another.And then another. The image above the article chilled his blood. The Ring, theycalled it. The gigantic alien structure that had left Venus and traveled to apoint a little less than 2 AU outside Uranus' orbit, then stopped and assembleditself.</p>\n<p>Holden read the news carefully as dread pulled at his gut. When he looked up,Naomi and Amos were in the doorway. Amos had his own hand terminal out. Holdensaw the same red bands on that display. <br />\n<em>(Continues...)</em> Excerpted from Abaddon's Gate by James S.A. Corey. Copyright © 2013 James S.A. Corey.

Ideal if you like restrained yet emotionally searing prose, steady pacing that lingers inside shattered minds, and bleak lyricism that refuses consolation or glory. (Storygraph)</em><br><br>______<br><br>This is the classic anti-war novel about young German soldiers during World War I. Twenty-year old Paul Baumer's world of work, duty, culture, and progress is shattered under the first bombardment in the trenches. He vows to fight against the principle of hate that pits young men of the same generation against each other. Few books have ever achieved such dramatic acclaim or enduring success.<br><br>______<br><br>EDITORIAL REVIEW: The Greatest Novel about the First World War and an International Bestseller All Quiet on the Western Front is probably the most famous anti-war novel ever written. The story is told by a young 'unknown soldier' in the trenches of Flanders during the First World War. Through his eyes we see all the realities of war; under fire, on patrol, waiting in the trenches, at home on leave, and in hospitals and dressing stations. Although there are vividly described incidents which remain in mind, there is no sense of adventure here, only the feeling of youth betrayed and a deceptively simple indictment of war - of any war - told for a whole generation of victims.</p></div>",

This book throws a lot at the reader: coming-of-age and real adulthood, talking cats and two-minute time machines, assassins and venture capitalists, hilarity and hefty philosophy, technology and Nature.

But when Laurence, a supercomputing genius, finds out that Patricia can talk to birds, even he isn't sure if their friendship will last. Fast forward a few years and Laurence is working for a billionaire who wants to create a machine that allows for intergalactic travel to save humans after they have destroyed their own world. Patricia, meanwhile, has honed her magic skills at a witch academy and is now wandering the city healing people when she isn't supposed to. With the help of smart devices, Patricia and Laurence find love, but the looming end of the world tests their relationship. Give to readers who don't mind a bit of quirky romance like Rainbow Rowell's Eleanor &amp; Park mixed in with their fast-paced Daniel H. Wilson-esqe futuristic science fiction. Patricia and Laurence are awkward, lovable, smart, and dorky, and readers will cheer for them to save the world hand in hand. VERDICT Perfect for fans of The Big Bang Theory, this novel has plenty of appeal for readers of fantasy, science fiction, and apocalyptic fiction.—Sarah Hill, Lake Land College, Mattoon, IL </p></div>",

(Storygraph)</em><br><br>______<br><br>In the tradition of Station Eleven, a literary thriller set partly on the roof of New York’s Museum of Natural History in a flooded future. <br><br>All the Water in the World is told in the voice of a girl gifted with a deep feeling for water. In the years after the glaciers melt, Nonie, her older sister and her parents and their researcher friends have stayed behind in an almost deserted New York City, creating a settlement on the roof of the American Museum of Natural History. The rule: Take from the exhibits only in dire need. They hunt and grow their food in Central Park as they work to save the collections of human history and science. When a superstorm breaches the city’s flood walls, Nonie and her family must escape north on the Hudson. They carry with them a book that holds their records of the lost collections.

The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can’t fix their own marriage.

Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment’s only bathroom, and you’ve got the worst group of hostages in the world.<br><br>Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over.

As Samantha plunges deeper and deeper into the Bunnies’ sinister yet saccharine world, beginning to take part in the ritualistic off-campus “Workshop” where they conjure their monstrous creations, the edges of reality begin to blur. Soon, her friendships with Ava and the Bunnies will be brought into deadly collision. <br><br>The spellbinding new novel from one of our most fearless chroniclers of the female experience, Bunny is a down-the-rabbit-hole tale of loneliness and belonging, friendship and desire, and the fantastic and terrible power of the imagination.</p></div>",

His first day is spent grappling with the fall-out from the last expedition. Area X itself remains a mystery. But, as instructed by a higher authority known only as The Voice, the self-styled Control must battle to ‘put his house in order’. From a series of interrogations, a cache of hidden notes and hours of profoundly troubling video footage, the mysteries of Area X begin to reveal themselves―and what they expose pushes Control to confront disturbing truths about both himself and the agency he’s promised to serve. Undermined and under pressure to make sense of everything, Rodriguez retreats into his past in a labyrinthine search for answers. Yet the more he uncovers, the more he risks, for the secrets of the Southern Reach are more sinister than anyone could have known. **</p></div>",

A well-timed leak has revealed that the US government might have engaged in first contact. Cora Sabino is doing everything she can to avoid the whole mess, since the force driving the controversy is her whistleblower father. Even though Cora hasn't spoken to him in years, his celebrity has caught the attention of the press, the Internet, the paparazzi, and the government--and with him in hiding, that attention is on her. She neither knows nor cares whether her father's leaks are a hoax, and wants nothing to do with him--until she learns just how deeply entrenched her family is in the cover-up, and that an extraterrestrial presence has been on Earth for decades.<br><br>Realizing the extent to which both she and the public have been lied to, she sets out to gather as much information as she can, and finds that the best way for her to uncover the truth is not as a whistleblower, but as an intermediary. The alien presence has been completely uncommunicative until she convinces one of them that she can act as their interpreter, becoming the first and only human vessel of communication. Their otherworldly connection will change everything she thought she knew about being human--and could unleash a force more sinister than she ever imagined.</p></div>",

Then, her heart starting to race, Mei thought, <em>She came back</em>.</p>\n<p>“Mommy?”</p>\n<p>From where Mei sat at her scaled-down easel, Miss Carrie’s knee blocked her view of the coatroom door. Mei’s hands were sticky with finger paints, red and blue and green swirling on her palms. She shifted forward and grabbed for Miss Carrie’s leg as much to move it as to help her stand up.</p>\n<p>“Mei!” Miss Carrie shouted.</p>\n<p>Mei looked at the smear of paint on Miss Carrie’s pants and the controlled anger on the woman’s broad, dark face.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, Miss Carrie.”</p>\n<p>“It’s okay,” the teacher said in a tight voice that meant it wasn’t, really, but Mei wasn’t going to be punished. “Please go wash your hands and then come put away your painting work. I’ll get this down and you can give it to your mother. It is a doggie?”</p>\n<p>“It’s a space monster.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a very nice space monster. Now go wash your hands, please, sweetheart.”</p>\n<p>Mei nodded, turned, and ran for the bathroom, her smock flapping around her like a rag caught in an air duct.</p>\n<p>“And don’t touch the wall!”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, Miss Carrie.”</p>\n<p>“It’s okay. Just clean it off after you’ve washed your hands.”</p>\n<p>She turned the water on full blast, the colors and swirls rushing off her skin. She went through the motions of drying her hands without caring whether she was dripping water or not. It felt like gravity had shifted, pulling her toward the doorway and the anteroom instead of down toward the ground. The other children watched, excited because she was excited, as Mei scrubbed the finger marks mostly off the wall and slammed the paint pots back into their box and the box onto its shelf. She pulled the smock up over her head rather than wait for Miss Carrie to help her, and stuffed it into the recycling bin.</p>\n<p>In the anteroom, Miss Carrie was standing with two other grown-ups, neither of them Mommy. One was a woman Mei didn’t know, space monster painting held gently in her hand and a polite smile on her face. The other was Doctor Strickland.</p>\n<p>“No, she’s been very good about getting to the toilet,” Miss Carrie was saying. “There are accidents now and then, of course.”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” the woman said.</p>\n<p>“Mei!” Doctor Strickland said, bending down so that he was hardly taller than she was. “How is my favorite girl?”</p>\n<p>“Where’s—” she began, but before she could say <em>Mommy</em> , Doctor Strickland scooped her up into his arms. He was bigger than Daddy, and he smelled like salt. He tipped her backward, tickling her sides, and she laughed hard enough that she couldn’t talk anymore.</p>\n<p>“Thank you so much,” the woman said.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Miss Carrie said, shaking the woman’s hand. “We really love having Mei in the classroom.”</p>\n<p>Doctor Strickland kept tickling Mei until the door to the Montessori cycled closed behind them. Then Mei caught her breath.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Mommy?”</p>\n<p>“She’s waiting for us,” Doctor Strickland said. “We’re taking you to her right now.”</p>\n<p>The newer hallways of Ganymede were wide and lush and the air recyclers barely ran. The knife-thin blades of areca palm fronds spilled up and out from dozens of hydroponic planters. The broad yellow-green striated leaves of devil’s ivy spilled down the walls. The dark green primitive leaves of Mother-in-Law’s Tongue thrust up beneath them both. Full-spectrum LEDs glowed white-gold. Daddy said it was just what sunlight looked like on Earth, and Mei pictured that planet as a huge complicated network of plants and hallways with the sun running in lines above them in a bright blue ceiling-sky, and you could climb over the walls and end up anywhere.</p>\n<p>Mei leaned her head on Doctor Strickland’s shoulder, looking over his back and naming each plant as they passed. <em>Sansevieria trifasciata. Epipremnum aureum</em>. Getting the names right always made Daddy grin. When she did it by herself, it made her body feel calmer.</p>\n<p>“More?” the woman asked. She was pretty, but Mei didn’t like her voice.</p>\n<p>“No,” Doctor Strickland said. “Mei here is the last one.”</p>\n<p>“ <em>Chysalidocarpus lutenscens</em> ,” Mei said.</p>\n<p>“All right,” the woman said, and then again, more softly: “All right.”</p>\n<p>The closer to the surface they got, the narrower the corridors became. The older hallways seemed dirtier even though there really wasn’t any dirt on them. It was just that they were more used up. The quarters and labs near the surface were where Mei’s grandparents had lived when they’d come to Ganymede. Back then, there hadn’t been anything deeper. The air up there smelled funny, and the recyclers always had to run, humming and thumping.</p>\n<p>The grown-ups didn’t talk to each other, but every now and then Doctor Strickland would remember Mei was there and ask her questions: What was her favorite cartoon on the station feed? Who was her best friend in school? What kinds of food did she eat for lunch that day? Mei expected him to start asking the other questions, the ones he always asked next, and she had her answers ready.</p>\n<p><em>Does your throat feel scratchy? No</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Did you wake up sweaty? No</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Was there any blood in your poop this week? No</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Did you get your medicine both times every day? Yes</em>.</p>\n<p>But this time, Doctor Strickland didn’t ask any of that. The corridors they went down got older and thinner until the woman had to walk behind them so that the men coming the other direction could pass. The woman still had Mei’s painting in her hand, rolled up in a tube so the paper wouldn’t get wrinkles.</p>\n<p>Doctor Strickland stopped at an unmarked door, shifted Mei to his other hip, and took his hand terminal out of his pants pocket. He keyed something into a program Mei had never seen before, and the door cycled open, seals making a rough popping sound like something out of an old movie. The hallway they walked into was full of junk and old metal boxes.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t the hospital,” Mei said.</p>\n<p>“This is a special hospital,” Doctor Strickland said. “I don’t think you’ve ever been here, have you?”</p>\n<p>It didn’t look like a hospital to Mei. It looked like one of the abandoned tubes that Daddy talked about sometimes. Leftover spaces from when Ganymede had first been built that no one used anymore except as storage. This one had a kind of airlock at the end, though, and when they passed through it, things looked a little more like a hospital. They were cleaner, anyway, and there was the smell of ozone, like in the decontamination cells.</p>\n<p>“Mei! Hi, Mei!”</p>\n<p>It was one of the big boys. Sandro. He was almost five. Mei waved at him as Doctor Strickland walked past. Mei felt better knowing the big boys were here too. If they were, then it was probably okay, even if the woman walking with Doctor Strickland wasn’t her mommy. Which reminded her…</p>\n<p>“Where’s Mommy?”</p>\n<p>“We’re going to go see Mommy in just a few minutes,” Doctor Strickland said. “We just have a couple more little things we need to do first.”</p>\n<p>“No,” Mei said. “I don’t want that.”</p>\n<p>He carried her into a room that looked a little like an examination room, only there weren’t any cartoon lions on the walls, and the tables weren’t shaped like grinning hippos. Doctor Strickland put her onto a steel examination table and rubbed her head. Mei crossed her arms and scowled.</p>\n<p>“I want Mommy,” Mei said, and made the same impatient grunt that Daddy would.</p>\n<p>“Well, you just wait right here, and I’ll see what I can do about that,” Doctor Strickland said with a smile. “Umea?”</p>\n<p>“I think we’re good to go. Check with ops, load up, and let’s release it.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll go let them know. You stay here.”</p>\n<p>The woman nodded, and Doctor Strickland walked back out the door. The woman looked down at her, the pretty face not smiling at all. Mei didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>“I want my painting,” Mei said. “That’s not for you. That’s for Mommy.”</p>\n<p>The woman looked at the painting in her hand as if she’d forgotten it was there. She unrolled it.</p>\n<p>“It’s Mommy’s space monster,” Mei said. This time, the woman smiled. She held out the painting, and Mei snatched it away. She made some wrinkles in the paper when she did, but she didn’t care. She crossed her arms again and scowled and grunted.</p>\n<p>“You like space monsters, kid?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>“I want my mommy.”</p>\n<p>The woman stepped close. She smelled like fake flowers and her fingers were skinny. She lifted Mei down to the floor.</p>\n<p>“C’mon, kid,” she said. “I’ll show you something.”</p>\n<p>The woman walked away and for a moment Mei hesitated. She didn’t like the woman, but she liked being alone even less. She followed. The woman walked down a short hallway, punched a keycode into a big metal door, like an old-fashioned airlock, and walked through when the door swung open. Mei followed her. The new room was cold. Mei didn’t like it. There wasn’t an examination table here, just a big glass box like they kept fish in at the aquarium, only it was dry inside, and the thing sitting there wasn’t a fish. The woman motioned Mei closer and, when Mei came near, knocked sharply on the glass.</p>\n<p>The thing inside looked up at the sound. It was a man, but he was naked and his skin didn’t look like skin. His eyes glowed blue like there was a fire in his head. And something was wrong with his hands.</p>\n<p>He reached toward the glass, and Mei started screaming.</p>\n<h2>Chapter One: Bobbie</h2>\n<p>Snoopy’s out again,” Private Hillman said. “I think his CO must be pissed at him.”</p>\n<p>Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper of the Martian Marine Corps upped the magnification on her armor’s heads-up display and looked in the direction Hillman was pointing. Twenty-five hundred meters away, a squad of four United Nations Marines were tromping around their outpost, backlit by the giant greenhouse dome they were guarding. A greenhouse dome identical in nearly all respects to the dome her own squad was currently guarding.</p>\n<p>One of the four UN Marines had black smudges on the sides of his helmet that looked like beagle ears.</p>\n<p>“Yep, that’s Snoopy,” Bobbie said. “Been on every patrol detail so far today. Wonder what he did.”</p>\n<p>Guard duty around the greenhouses on Ganymede meant doing what you could to keep your mind occupied. Including speculating on the lives of the Marines on the other side.</p>\n<p>The other side. Eighteen months before, there hadn’t been sides. The inner planets had all been one big, happy, slightly dysfunctional family. Then Eros, and now the two superpowers were dividing up the solar system between them, and the one moon neither side was willing to give up was Ganymede, breadbasket of the Jovian system.</p>\n<p>As the only moon with any magnetosphere, it was the only place where dome-grown crops stood a chance in Jupiter’s harsh radiation belt, and even then the domes and habitats still had to be shielded to protect civilians from the eight rems a day burning off Jupiter and onto the moon’s surface.</p>\n<p>Bobbie’s armor had been designed to let a soldier walk through a nuclear bomb crater minutes after the blast. It also worked well at keeping Jupiter from frying Martian Marines.</p>\n<p>Behind the Earth soldiers on patrol, their dome glowed in a shaft of weak sunlight captured by enormous orbital mirrors. Even with the mirrors, most terrestrial plants would have died, starved of sunlight. Only the heavily modified versions the Ganymede scientists cranked out could hope to survive in the trickle of light the mirrors fed them.</p>\n<p>“Be sunset soon,” Bobbie said, still watching the Earth Marines outside their little guard hut, knowing they were watching her too. In addition to Snoopy, she spotted the one they called Stumpy because he or she couldn’t be much over a meter and a quarter tall. She wondered what their nickname for her was. Maybe Big Red. Her armor still had the Martian surface camouflage on it. She hadn’t been on Ganymede long enough to get it resurfaced with mottled gray and white.</p>\n<p>One by one over the course of five minutes, the orbital mirrors winked out as Ganymede passed behind Jupiter for a few hours. The glow from the greenhouse behind her changed to actinic blue as the artificial lights came on. While the overall light level didn’t go down much, the shadows shifted in strange and subtle ways. Above, the sun—not even a disk from here as much as the brightest star—flashed as it passed behind Jupiter’s limb, and for a moment the planet’s faint ring system was visible.</p>\n<p>“They’re going back in,” Corporal Travis said. “Snoop’s bringing up the rear. Poor guy. Can we bail too?”</p>\n<p>Bobbie looked around at the featureless dirty ice of Ganymede. Even in her high-tech armor she could feel the moon’s chill.</p>\n<p>“Nope.”</p>\n<p>Her squad grumbled but fell in line as she led them on a slow low-gravity shuffle around the dome. In addition to Hillman and Travis, she had a green private named Gourab on this particular patrol. And even though he’d been in the Marines all of about a minute and a half, he grumbled just as loud as the other two in his Mariner Valley drawl.</p>\n<p>She couldn’t blame them. It was make-work. Something for the Martian soldiers on Ganymede to do to keep them busy. If Earth decided it needed Ganymede all to itself, four grunts walking around the greenhouse dome wouldn’t stop them. With dozens of Earth and Mars warships in a tense standoff in orbit, if hostilities broke out the ground pounders would probably find out only when the surface bombardment began.</p>\n<p>To her left, the dome rose to almost half a kilometer: triangular glass panels separated by gleaming copper-colored struts that turned the entire structure into a massive Faraday cage. Bobbie had never been inside one of the greenhouse domes. She’d been sent out from Mars as part of a surge in troops to the outer planets and had been walking patrols on the surface almost since day one. Ganymede to her was a spaceport, a small Marine base, and the even smaller guard outpost she currently called home.</p>\n<p>As they shuffled around the dome, Bobbie watched the unremarkable landscape. Ganymede didn’t change much without a catastrophic event. The surface was mostly silicate rock and water ice a few degrees warmer than space. The atmosphere was oxygen so thin it could pass as an industrial vacuum. Ganymede didn’t erode or weather. It changed when rocks fell on it from space, or when warm water from the liquid core forced itself onto the surface and created short-lived lakes. Neither thing happened all that often. At home on Mars, wind and dust changed the landscape hourly. Here, she was walking through the footsteps of the day before and the day before and the day before. And if she never came back, those footprints would outlive her. Privately, she thought it was sort of creepy.</p>\n<p>A rhythmic squeaking started to cut through the normally smooth hiss and thump sounds her powered armor made. She usually kept the suit’s HUD minimized. It got so crowded with information that a marine knew everything except what was actually in front of her. Now she pulled it up, using blinks and eye movements to page over to the suit diagnostic screen. A yellow telltale warned her that the suit’s left knee actuator was low on hydraulic fluid. Must be a leak somewhere, but a slow one, because the suit couldn’t find it.</p>\n<p>“Hey, guys, hold up a minute,” Bobbie said. “Hilly, you have any extra hydraulic fluid in your pack?”</p>\n<p>“Yep,” said Hillman, already pulling it out.</p>\n<p>“Give my left knee a squirt, would you?”</p>\n<p>While Hillman crouched in front of her, working on her suit, Gourab and Travis began an argument that seemed to be about sports. Bobbie tuned it out.</p>\n<p>“This suit is ancient,” Hillman said. “You really oughta upgrade. This sort of thing is just going to happen more and more often, you know.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I should,” Bobbie said. But the truth was that was easier said than done. Bobbie was not the right shape to fit into one of the standard suits, and the Marines made her jump through a series of flaming hoops every time she requisitioned a new custom one. At a bit over two meters tall, she was only slightly above average height for a Martian male, but thanks in part to her Polynesian ancestry, she weighed in at over a hundred kilos at one g. None of it was fat, but her muscles seemed to get bigger every time she even walked through a weight room. As a marine, she trained all the time.</p>\n<p>The suit she had now was the first one in twelve years of active duty that actually fit well. And even though it was beginning to show its age, it was just easier to try to keep it running than beg and plead for a new one.</p>\n<p>Hillman was starting to put his tools away when Bobbie’s radio crackled to life.</p>\n<p>“Outpost four to stickman. Come in, stickman.”</p>\n<p>“Roger four,” Bobbie replied. “This is stickman one. Go ahead.”</p>\n<p>“Stickman one, where are you guys? You’re half an hour late and some shit is going down over here.”</p>\n<p>“Sorry, four, equipment trouble,” Bobbie said, wondering what sort of shit might be going down, but not enough to ask about it over an open frequency.</p>\n<p>“Return to the outpost immediately. We have shots fired at the UN outpost. We’re going into lockdown.”</p>\n<p>It took Bobbie a moment to parse that. She could see her men staring at her, their faces a mix of puzzlement and fear.</p>\n<p>“Uh, the Earth guys are shooting at you?” she finally asked.</p>\n<p>“Not yet, but they’re shooting. Get your asses back here.”</p>\n<p>Hillman pushed to his feet. Bobbie flexed her knee once and got greens on her diagnostic. She gave Hilly a nod of thanks, then said, “Double-time it back to the outpost. Go.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie and her squad were still half a kilometer from the outpost when the general alert went out. Her suit’s HUD came up on its own, switching to combat mode. The sensor package went to work looking for hostiles and linked up to one of the satellites for a top-down view. She felt the click as the gun built into the suit’s right arm switched to free-fire mode.</p>\n<p>A thousand alarms would be sounding if an orbital bombardment had begun, but she couldn’t help looking up at the sky anyway. No flashes or missile trails. Nothing but Jupiter’s bulk.</p>\n<p>Bobbie took off for the outpost in a long, loping run. Her squad followed without a word. A person trained in the use of a strength-augmenting suit running in low gravity could cover a lot of ground quickly. The outpost came into view around the curve of the dome in just a few seconds, and a few seconds after that, the cause of the alarm.</p>\n<p>UN Marines were charging the Martian outpost. The yearlong cold war was going hot. Somewhere deep behind the cool mental habits of training and discipline, she was surprised. She hadn’t really thought this day would come.</p>\n<p>The rest of her platoon were out of the outpost and arranged in a firing line facing the UN position. Someone had driven <em>Yojimbo</em> out onto the line, and the four-meter-tall combat mech towered over the other marines, looking like a headless giant in power armor, its massive cannon moving slowly as it tracked the incoming Earth troops. The UN soldiers were covering the 2,500 meters between the two outposts at a dead run.</p>\n<p><em>Why isn’t anyone talking?</em> she wondered. The silence coming from her platoon was eerie.</p>\n<p>And then, just as her squad got to the firing line, her suit squealed a jamming warning at her. The top-down vanished as she lost contact with the satellite. Her team’s life signs and equipment status reports went dead as her link to their suits was cut off. The faint static of the open comm channel disappeared, leaving an even more unsettling silence.</p>\n<p>She used hand motions to place her team at the right flank, then moved up the line to find Lieutenant Givens, her CO. She spotted his suit right at the center of the line, standing almost directly under <em>Yojimbo</em>. She ran up and placed her helmet against his.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on, El Tee?” she shouted.</p>\n<p>He gave her an irritated look and yelled, “Your guess is as good as mine. We can’t tell them to back off because of the jamming, and visual warnings are being ignored. Before the radio cut out, I got authorization to fire if they come within half a klick of our position.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie had a couple hundred more questions, but the UN troops would cross the five-hundred-meter mark in just a few more seconds, so she ran back to anchor the right flank with her squad. Along the way, she had her suit count the incoming forces and mark them all as hostiles. The suit reported seven targets. Less than a third of the UN troops at their outpost.</p>\n<p><em>This makes no sense</em>.</p>\n<p>She had her suit draw a line on the HUD at the five-hundred-meter mark. She didn’t tell her boys that was the free-fire zone. She didn’t need to. They’d open fire when she did without needing to know why.</p>\n<p>The UN soldiers had crossed the one-kilometer mark, still without firing a shot. They were coming in a scattered formation, with six out front in a ragged line and a seventh bringing up the rear about seventy meters behind. Her suit HUD selected the figure on the far left of the enemy line as her target, picking the one closest to her by default. Something itched at the back of her brain, and she overrode the suit and selected the target at the rear and told it to magnify.</p>\n<p>The small figure suddenly enlarged in her targeting reticule. She felt a chill move down her back, and magnified again.</p>\n<p>The figure chasing the six UN Marines wasn’t wearing an environment suit. Nor was it, properly speaking, human. Its skin was covered in chitinous plates, like large black scales. Its head was a massive horror, easily twice as large as it should have been and covered in strange protruding growths.</p>\n<p>But most disturbing of all were its hands. Far too large for its body, and too long for their width, they were a childhood nightmare version of hands. The hands of the troll under the bed or the witch sneaking in through the window. They flexed and grasped at nothing with a constant manic energy.</p>\n<p>The Earth forces weren’t attacking. They were retreating.</p>\n<p>“Shoot the thing chasing them,” Bobbie yelled to no one.</p>\n<p>Before the UN soldiers could cross the half-kilometer line that would cause the Martians to open fire, the thing caught them.</p>\n<p>“Oh, holy shit,” Bobbie whispered. “Holy <em>shit</em>.”</p>\n<p>It grabbed one UN Marine in its huge hands and tore him in half like paper. Titanium-and-ceramic armor ripped as easily as the flesh inside, spilling broken bits of technology and wet human viscera indiscriminately onto the ice. The remaining five soldiers ran even harder, but the monster chasing them barely slowed as it killed.</p>\n<p>“Shoot it shoot it shoot it,” Bobbie yelled, and opened fire. Her training and the technology of her combat suit combined to make her an extremely efficient killing machine. As soon as her finger pulled the trigger on her suit’s gun, a stream of two-millimeter armor-piercing rounds streaked out at the creature at more than a thousand meters per second. In just under a second she’d fired fifty rounds at it. The creature was a relatively slow-moving human-sized target, running in a straight line. Her targeting computer could do ballistic corrections that would let her hit a softball-sized object moving at supersonic speeds. Every bullet she fired at the monster hit.</p>\n<p>It didn’t matter.</p>\n<p>The rounds went through it, probably not slowing appreciably before they exited. Each exit wound sprouted a spray of black filaments that fell onto the snow instead of blood. It was like shooting water. The wounds closed almost faster than they were created; the only sign the thing had even been hit was the trail of black fibers in its wake.</p>\n<p>And then it caught a second UN Marine. Instead of tearing him to pieces like it had the last one, it spun and hurled the fully armored Earther—probably massing more than five hundred kilos total—toward Bobbie. Her HUD tracked the UN soldier on his upward arc and helpfully informed her that the monster had thrown him not <em>toward</em> her but <em>at</em> her. In a very flat trajectory. Which meant fast.</p>\n<p>She dove to the side as quickly as her bulky suit would let her. The hapless UN Marine swiped Hillman, who’d been standing next to her, and then both of them were gone, bouncing down the ice at lethal speeds.</p>\n<p>By the time she’d turned back to the monster, it had killed two more UN soldiers.</p>\n<p>The entire Martian line opened fire on it, including <em>Yojimbo</em> ’s big cannon. The two remaining Earth soldiers diverged and ran at angles away from the thing, trying to give their Martian counterparts an open firing lane. The creature was hit hundreds, thousands of times. It stitched itself back together while remaining at a full run, never more than slowing when one of <em>Yojimbo</em> ’s cannon shots detonated nearby.</p>\n<p>Bobbie, back on her feet, joined in the barrage of fire but it didn’t make any difference. The creature slammed into the Martian line, killing two marines faster than the eye could follow. <em>Yojimbo</em> slid to one side, far more nimble than a machine of its size should be. Bobbie thought Sa’id must be driving it. He bragged he could make the big mech dance the tango when he wanted to. That didn’t matter either. Even before Sa’id could bring the mech’s cannon around for a point-blank shot, the creature ran right up its side, gripped the pilot hatch, and tore the door off its hinges. Sa’id was snatched from his cockpit harness and hurled sixty meters straight up.</p>\n<p>The other marines had begun to fall back, firing as they went. Without radio, there was no way to coordinate the retreat. Bobbie found herself running toward the dome with the rest. The small and distant part of her mind that wasn’t panicking knew that the dome’s glass and metal would offer no protection against something that could tear an armored man in half or rip a nine-ton mech to pieces. That part of her mind recognized the futility in attempting to override her terror.</p>\n<p>By the time she found the external door into the dome, there was only one other marine left with her. Gourab. Up close, she could see his face through the armored glass of his helmet. He screamed something at her she couldn’t hear. She started to lean forward to touch helmets with him when he shoved her backward onto the ice. He was hammering on the door controls with one metal fist, trying to smash his way in, when the creature caught him and peeled the helmet off his suit with one casual swipe. Gourab stood for a moment, face in vacuum, eyes blinking and mouth open in a soundless scream; then the creature tore off his head as easily as it had his helmet.</p>\n<p>It turned and looked at Bobbie, still flat on her back.</p>\n<p>Up close, she could see that it had bright blue eyes. A glowing, electric blue. They were beautiful. She raised her gun and held down the trigger for half a second before she realized she’d run out of ammo long before. The creature looked at her gun with what she would have sworn was curiosity, then looked into her eyes and cocked its head to one side.</p>\n<p><em>This is it</em> , she thought. <em>This is how I go out, and I’m not going to know what did it, or why</em>. Dying she could handle. Dying without any answers seemed terribly cruel.</p>\n<p>The creature took one step toward her, then stopped and shuddered. A new pair of limbs burst out of its midsection and writhed in the air like tentacles. Its head, already grotesque, seemed to swell up. The blue eyes flashed as bright as the lights in the domes.</p>\n<p>And then it exploded in a ball of fire that hurled her away across the ice and slammed her into a low ridge hard enough for the impact-absorbing gel in her suit to go rigid, freezing her in place.</p>\n<p>She lay on her back, fading toward unconsciousness. The night sky above her began to flash with light. The ships in orbit, shooting each other.</p>\n<p><em>Cease fire</em> , she thought, pressing it out into the blackness. <em>They were retreating. Cease fire</em>. Her radio was still out, her suit dead. She couldn’t tell anyone that the UN Marines hadn’t been attacking.</p>\n<p>Or that something else had.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Two: Holden</h2>\n<p>The coffeemaker was broken again.</p>\n<p><em>Again</em>.</p>\n<p>Jim Holden clicked the red brew button in and out several more times, knowing it wouldn’t matter, but helpless to stop himself. The massive and gleaming coffeemaker, designed to brew enough to keep a Martian naval crew happy, refused to make a single cup. Or even a noise. It wasn’t just refusing to brew; it was refusing to <em>try</em>. Holden closed his eyes against the caffeine headache that threatened in his temples and hit the button on the nearest wall panel to open the shipwide comm.</p>\n<p>“Amos,” he said.</p>\n<p>The comm wasn’t working.</p>\n<p>Feeling increasingly ridiculous, he pushed the button for the 1MC channel several more times. Nothing. He opened his eyes and saw that all the lights on the panel were out. Then he turned around and saw that the lights on the refrigerator and the ovens were out. It wasn’t just the coffeemaker; the entire galley was in open revolt. Holden looked at the ship name, <em>Rocinante</em> , newly stenciled onto the galley wall, and said, “Baby, why do you hurt me when I love you so much?”</p>\n<p>He pulled out his hand terminal and called Naomi.</p>\n<p>After several moments, she finally answered, “Uh, hello?”</p>\n<p>“The galley doesn’t work, where’s Amos?”</p>\n<p>A pause. “You called me from the galley? While we are on the same ship? The wall panel just one step too far away?”</p>\n<p>“The wall panel in the galley doesn’t work either. When I said, ‘The galley doesn’t work,’ it wasn’t clever hyperbole. It literally means that not one thing in the galley works. I called you because you carry your terminal and Amos almost never does. And also because he never tells me what he’s working on, but he always tells you. So, where is Amos?”</p>\n<p>Naomi laughed. It was a lovely sound, and it never failed to put a smile on Holden’s face. “He told me he was going to be doing some rewiring.”</p>\n<p>“Do you have power up there? Are we hurtling out of control and you guys were trying to figure out how to break the news to me?”</p>\n<p>Holden could hear tapping from Naomi’s end. She hummed to herself as she worked.</p>\n<p>“Nope,” she said. “Only area without power seems to be the galley. Also, Alex says we’re less than an hour from fighting with space pirates. Want to come up to ops and fight pirates?”</p>\n<p>“I can’t fight pirates without coffee. I’m going to find Amos,” Holden said, then hung up and put his terminal back in his pocket.</p>\n<p>Holden moved to the ladder that ran down the keel of the ship, and called up the lift. The fleeing pirate ship could only sustain about 1 g for extended flight, so Holden’s pilot, Alex Kamal, had them flying at 1.3 g to intercept. Anything over 1 g made the ladder dangerous to use.</p>\n<p>A few seconds later, the deck hatch clanged open, and the lift whined to a stop at his feet. He stepped on and tapped the button for the engineering deck. The lift began its slow crawl down the shaft, deck hatches opening at its approach, then slamming shut once he had passed.</p>\n<p>Amos Burton was in the machine shop, one deck above engineering. He had a complex-looking device half disassembled on the workbench in front of him and was working on it with a solder gun. He wore a gray jumpsuit several sizes too small for him, which strained to contain his broad shoulders when he moved, the old ship name <em>Tachi</em> still embroidered on the back.</p>\n<p>Holden stopped the lift and said, “Amos, the galley doesn’t work.”</p>\n<p>Amos waved one thick arm in an impatient gesture without stopping his work. Holden waited. After another couple seconds of soldering, Amos finally put down the tool and turned around.</p>\n<p>“Yep, it doesn’t work because I got this little fucker yanked out of it,” he said, pointing at the device he’d been soldering.</p>\n<p>“Can you put it back?”</p>\n<p>“Nope, at least not yet. Not done working on it.”</p>\n<p>Holden sighed. “Is it important that we disable the galley to fix this thing just before confronting a bloodthirsty band of space pirates? Because my head is really starting to ache, and I’d love to get a cup of coffee before, you know, doing battle.”</p>\n<p>“Yep, it was important,” Amos said. “Should I explain why? Or you want to take my word for it?”</p>\n<p>Holden nodded. While he didn’t miss much about his days in the Earth Navy, he did find that he occasionally got nostalgic for the absolute respect for the chain of command. On the <em>Rocinante</em> the title “captain” was much more nebulously defined. Rewiring things was Amos’ job, and he would resist the idea that he had to inform Holden anytime he was doing it.</p>\n<p>Holden let it drop.</p>\n<p>“Okay,” he said. “But I wish you’d warned me ahead of time. I’m going to be cranky without my coffee.”</p>\n<p>Amos grinned at him and pushed his cap back on his mostly bald head.</p>\n<p>“Shit, Cap, I can cover you on that,” he said, then reached back and grabbed a massive metal thermos off the bench. “I made some emergency supplies before I shut the galley down.”</p>\n<p>“Amos, I apologize for all the mean things I was thinking about you just now.”</p>\n<p>Amos waved it off and turned back to his work. “Take it. I already had a cup.”</p>\n<p>Holden climbed back onto the lift and rode it up to the operations deck, the thermos clutched in both hands like a life preserver.</p>\n<p>Naomi was seated at the sensor and communications panel, tracking their progress in pursuit of the fleeing pirates. Holden could see at a glance that they were much closer than the last estimate he’d received. He strapped himself into the combat operations couch. He opened a nearby cabinet and, guessing they might be at low g or in free fall in the near future, pulled out a drinking bulb for his coffee.</p>\n<p>As he filled it from the thermos’s nipple, he said, “We’re closing awful fast. What’s up?”</p>\n<p>“Pirate ship has slowed down quite a bit from its initial one g acceleration. They dropped to half a g for a couple minutes, then stopped accelerating altogether a minute ago. The computer tracked some fluctuations in drive output just before they slowed, so I think we chased them too hard.”</p>\n<p>“They broke their ship?”</p>\n<p>“They broke their ship.”</p>\n<p>Holden took a long drink out of the bulb, scalding his tongue in the process and not caring.</p>\n<p>“How long to intercept now?”</p>\n<p>“Five minutes, tops. Alex was waiting to do the final decel burn until you were up here and belted in.”</p>\n<p>Holden tapped the comm panel’s 1MC button and said, “Amos, buckle up. Five minutes to badguys.” Then he switched to the cockpit channel and said, “Alex, what’s the word?”</p>\n<p>“I do believe they broke their ship,” Alex replied in his Martian Mariner Valley drawl.</p>\n<p>“That seems to be the consensus,” Holden said.</p>\n<p>“Makes runnin’ away a bit harder.”</p>\n<p>The Mariner Valley had originally been settled by Chinese, East Indians, and Texans. Alex had the dark complexion and jet-black hair of an East Indian. Coming as he did from Earth, Holden always found it strangely disconcerting when an exaggerated Texas drawl came from someone his brain said should be speaking with Punjabi accents.</p>\n<p>“And it makes our day easier,” Holden replied, warming up the combat ops panel. “Bring us to relative stop at ten thousand klicks. I’m going to paint them with the targeting laser and turn on the point defense cannons. Open the outer doors to the tubes, too. No reason not to look as threatening as possible.”</p>\n<p>“Roger that, boss,” Alex replied.</p>\n<p>Naomi swiveled in her chair and gave Holden a grin. “Fighting space pirates. Very romantic.”</p>\n<p>Holden couldn’t help smiling back. Even wearing a Martian naval officer’s jumpsuit that was three sizes too short and five sizes too big around for her long and thin Belter frame, she looked beautiful to him. Her long and curly black hair was pulled into an unruly tail behind her head. Her features were a striking mix of Asian, South American, and African that was unusual even in the melting pot of the Belt. He glanced at his brown-haired Montana farm boy reflection in a darkened panel and felt very generic by comparison.</p>\n<p>“You know how much I like anything that gets you to say the word ‘romantic,’ ” he said. “But I’m afraid I lack your enthusiasm. We started out saving the solar system from a horrific alien menace. Now this?”</p>\n<p>Holden had only known one cop well, and him briefly. During the massive and unpleasant series of clusterfucks that now went under the shorthand “the Eros incident,” Holden had teamed up for a time with a thin, gray, broken man called Miller. By the time they’d met, Miller had already walked away from his official job to obsessively follow a missing persons case.</p>\n<p>They’d never precisely been friends, but they’d managed to stop the human race from being wiped out by a corporation’s self-induced sociopathy and a recovered alien weapon that everyone in human history had mistaken for a moon of Saturn. By that standard, at least, the partnership had been a success.</p>\n<p>Holden had been a naval officer for six years. He’d seen people die, but only from the vantage of a radar screen. On Eros, he’d seen thousands of people die, up close and in horrific ways. He’d killed a couple of them himself. The radiation dose he’d received there meant he had to take constant medications to stop the cancers that kept blooming in his tissues. He’d still gotten off lighter than Miller.</p>\n<p>Because of Miller, the alien infection had landed on Venus instead of Earth. But that hadn’t killed it. Whatever the alien’s hijacked, confused programming was, it was still going on under that planet’s thick cloud cover, and no one had so far been able to offer any scientific conclusions more compelling than <em>Hmm. Weird</em>.</p>\n<p>Saving humanity had cost the old, tired Belter detective his life.</p>\n<p>Saving humanity had turned Holden into an employee of the Outer Planets Alliance tracking down pirates. Even on the bad days, he had to think he’d gotten the better end of that deal.</p>\n<p>“Thirty seconds to intercept,” Alex said.</p>\n<p>Holden pulled his mind back to the present and called down to engineering. “You all strapped in down there, Amos?”</p>\n<p>“Roger, Cap. Ready to go. Try not to get my girl all shot up.”</p>\n<p>“No one’s shooting anyone today,” Holden said after he shut the comm link off. Naomi heard him and raised an eyebrow in question. “Naomi, give me comms. I want to call our friends out there.”</p>\n<p>A second later, the comm controls appeared on his panel. He aimed a tightbeam at the pirate ship and waited for the link light to go green. When it did, he said, “Undesignated light freighter, this is Captain James Holden of the Outer Planets Alliance missile frigate <em>Rocinante</em>. Please respond.”</p>\n<p>His headset was silent except for the faint static of background radiation.</p>\n<p>“Look, guys, let’s not play games. I know you know who I am. I also know that five days ago, you attacked the food freighter <em>Somnambulist</em> , disabled its engines, and stole six thousand kilos of protein and all of their air. Which is pretty much all I need to know about you.”</p>\n<p>More staticky silence.</p>\n<p>“So here’s the deal. I’m tired of following you, and I’m not going to let you stall me while you fix your broken ship and then lead me on another merry chase. If you don’t signal your full and complete surrender in the next sixty seconds, I am going to fire a pair of torpedoes with high-yield plasma warheads and melt your ship into glowing slag. Then I’m going to fly back home and sleep really well tonight.”</p>\n<p>The static was finally broken by a boy who sounded way too young to have already decided on a life of piracy.</p>\n<p>“You can’t do that. The OPA isn’t a real government. You can’t legally do shit to me, so back the fuck off,” the voice said, sounding like it was on the verge of a pubescent squeak the entire time.</p>\n<p>“Seriously? That’s the best you’ve got?” Holden replied. “Look, forget the debate about legality and what constitutes actual governmental authority for a minute. Look at the ladar returns you’re getting from my ship. While you are in a cobbled-together light freighter that someone welded a homemade gauss cannon onto, I’m in a state-of-the-art Martian torpedo bomber with enough firepower to slag a small moon.”</p>\n<p>The voice on the other end didn’t reply.</p>\n<p>“Guys, even if you don’t recognize me as the appropriate legal authority, can we at least agree that I can blow you up anytime I want to?”</p>\n<p>The comm remained silent.</p>\n<p>Holden sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. In spite of the caffeine, his headache was refusing to go away. Leaving the channel open to the pirate ship, he opened another channel to the cockpit.</p>\n<p>“Alex, put a short burst from the forward point defense cannons through that freighter. Aim for midships.”</p>\n<p>“Wait!” yelled the kid on the other ship. “We surrender! Jesus <em>Christ</em>!”</p>\n<p>Holden stretched out in the zero g, enjoying it after the days of acceleration, and grinned to himself. <em>No one gets shot today</em> indeed.</p>\n<p>“Naomi, tell our new friends how to give remote control of their ship to you, and let’s take them back to Tycho Station for the OPA tribunals to figure out. Alex, once they have their engines back up, plot us a return trip at a nice comfortable half g. I’ll be down in sick bay trying to find aspirin.”</p>\n<p>Holden unbuckled his crash couch harness and pushed off to the deck ladder. Along the way, his hand terminal started beeping. It was Fred Johnson, the nominal leader of the OPA and their personal patron on the Tycho corporation’s manufacturing station, which was also now doubling as the de facto OPA headquarters.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Fred, caught our naughty pirates. Bringing them back for trial.”</p>\n<p>Fred’s large dark face crinkled into a grin. “That’s a switch. Got tired of blowing them up?”</p>\n<p>“Nope, just finally found some who believed me when I said I would.”</p>\n<p>Fred’s grin turned into a frown. “Listen, Jim, that’s not why I called. I need you back at Tycho on the double. Something’s happening on Ganymede…”</p>\n<h2>Chapter Three: Prax</h2>\n<p>Praxidike Meng stood in the doorway of the staging barn, looking out at the fields of softly waving leaves so utterly green they were almost black, and panicked. The dome arched above him, darker than it should have been. Power to the grow lights had been cut, and the mirrors… He couldn’t think about the mirrors.</p>\n<p>The flickers of fighting ships looked like glitches on a cheap screen, colors and movements that shouldn’t have been there. The sign that something was very wrong. He licked his lips. There had to be a way. There had to be some way to save them.</p>\n<p>“Prax,” Doris said. “We have to go. Now.”</p>\n<p>The cutting edge of low-resource agricultural botany, the <em>Glycine kenon</em> , a type of soybean so heavily modified it was an entirely new species, represented the last eight years of his life. They were the reason his parents still hadn’t seen their only granddaughter in the flesh. They, and a few other things, had ended his marriage. He could see the eight subtly different strains of engineered chloroplasts in the fields, each one trying to spin out the most protein per photon. His hands were trembling. He was going to vomit.</p>\n<p>“We have maybe five more minutes to impact,” Doris said. “We have to evacuate.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t see it,” Prax said.</p>\n<p>“It’s coming fast enough, by the time you see it, you won’t see it. Everyone else has already gone. We’re the last ones. Now get in the lift.”</p>\n<p>The great orbital mirrors had always been his allies, shining down on his fields like a hundred pale suns. He couldn’t believe that they’d betray him. It was an insane thought. The mirror plummeting toward the surface of Ganymede—toward his greenhouse, his soybeans, his life’s work—hadn’t chosen anything. It was a victim of cause and effect, the same as everything else.</p>\n<p>“I’m about to leave,” Doris said. “If you’re here in four minutes, you’ll die.”</p>\n<p>“Wait,” Prax said. He ran out into the dome. At the edge of the nearest field, he fell to his knees and dug into the rich black soil. The smell of it was like a good patchouli. He pushed his fingers in as deep as he could, cupping a root ball. The small, fragile plant came up in his hands.</p>\n<p>Doris was in the industrial lift, ready to descend into the caves and tunnels of the station. Prax sprinted for her. With the plant to save, the dome suddenly felt horribly dangerous. He threw himself through the door and Doris pressed the control display. The wide metal room of the lift lurched, shifted, and began its descent. Normally, it would have carried heavy equipment: the tiller, the tractor, the tons of humus taken from the station recycling processors. Now it was only the three of them: Prax sitting cross-legged on the floor, the soybean seedling nodding in his lap, Doris chewing her lower lip and watching her hand terminal. The lift felt too big.</p>\n<p>“The mirror could miss,” Prax said.</p>\n<p>“It could. But it’s thirteen hundred tons of glass and metal. The shock wave will be fairly large.”</p>\n<p>“The dome might hold.”</p>\n<p>“No,” she said, and Prax stopped talking to her.</p>\n<p>The cart hummed and clanked, falling deeper under the surface ice, sliding into the network of tunnels that made up the bulk of the station. The air smelled like heating elements and industrial lubricant. Even now, he couldn’t believe they’d done it. He couldn’t believe the military bastards had actually started shooting each other. No one, anywhere, could really be that shortsighted. Except that it seemed they could.</p>\n<p>In the months since the Earth-Mars alliance had shattered, he’d gone from constant and gnawing fear to cautious hope to complacency. Every day that the United Nations and the Martians hadn’t started something had been another bit of evidence that they wouldn’t. He’d let himself think that everything was more stable than it looked. Even if things got bad and there was a shooting war, it wouldn’t be here. Ganymede was where the food came from. With its magnetosphere, it was the safest place for pregnant women to gestate, claiming the lowest incidence of birth defects and stillbirth in the outer planets. It was the center of everything that made human expansion into the solar system possible. Their work was as precious as it was fragile, and the people in charge would never let the war come here.</p>\n<p>Doris said something obscene. Prax looked up at her. She ran a hand through her thin white hair, turned, and spat.</p>\n<p>“Lost connectivity,” she said, holding up the hand terminal. “Whole network’s locked down.”</p>\n<p>“By who?”</p>\n<p>“Station security. United Nations. Mars. How would I know?”</p>\n<p>“But if they—”</p>\n<p>The concussion was like a giant fist coming down on the cart’s roof. The emergency brakes kicked in with a bone-shaking clang. The lights went out, darkness swallowing them for two hummingbird-fast heartbeats. Four battery-powered emergency LEDs popped on, then off again as the cart’s power came back. The critical failure diagnostics started to run: motors humming, lifts clicking, the tracking interface spooling through checksums like an athlete stretching before a run. Prax stood up and walked to the control panel. The shaft sensors reported minimal atmospheric pressure and falling. He felt a shudder as containment doors closed somewhere above them and the exterior pressure started to rise. The air in the shaft had been blown out into space before the emergency systems could lock down. His dome was compromised.</p>\n<p>His dome was gone.</p>\n<p>He put his hand to his mouth, not realizing he was smearing soil across his chin until he’d already done it. Part of his mind was skittering over the things that needed to be done to save the project—contact his project manager at RMD-Southern, refile the supplemental grant applications, get the data backups to rebuild the viral insertion samples—while another part had gone still and eerily calm. The sense of being two men—one bent on desperate measures, the other already in the numb of mourning—felt like the last weeks of his marriage.</p>\n<p>Doris turned to him, a weary amusement plucking at her wide lips. She put out her hand.</p>\n<p>“It was a pleasure working with you, Dr. Meng.”</p>\n<p>The cart shuddered as the emergency brakes retracted. Another impact came from much farther off. A mirror or a ship falling. Soldiers shelling each other on the surface. Maybe even fighting deeper in the station. There was no way to know. He shook her hand.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Bourne,” he said. “It has been an honor.”</p>\n<p>They took a long, silent moment at the graveside of their previous lives. Doris sighed.</p>\n<p>“All right,” she said. “Let’s get the hell out of here.”</p>\n<p>Mei’s day care was deep in the body of the moon, but the tube station was only a few hundred yards from the cart’s loading dock, and the express trip down to her was no more than ten minutes. Or would have been if they were running. In three decades of living on Ganymede, Prax had never even noticed that the tube stations had security doors.</p>\n<p>The four soldiers standing in front of the closed station wore thick plated armor painted in shifting camouflage lines the same shades of beige and steel as the corridor. They carried intimidatingly large assault rifles and scowled at the crowd of a dozen or more pressing in around them.</p>\n<p>“I am on the transportation board,” a tall, thin, dark-skinned woman was saying, punctuating each word by tapping her finger on one soldier’s chest plate. “If you don’t let us past, then you’re in trouble. Serious trouble.”</p>\n<p>“How long is it going to be down?” a man asked. “I need to get home. How long is it going to be down?”</p>\n<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” the soldier on the left shouted. She had a powerful voice. It cut through the rumble and murmur of the crowd like a teacher speaking to restless schoolchildren. “This settlement is in security lockdown. Until the military action is resolved, there is no movement between levels except by official personnel.”</p>\n<p>“Whose side are you on?” someone shouted. “Are you Martians? Whose side are you <em>on</em>?”</p>\n<p>“In the meantime,” the soldier went on, ignoring the question, “we are going to ask you all to be patient. As soon as it’s safe to travel, the tube system will be opened. Until that time, we’re going to ask you to remain calm for your own safety.”</p>\n<p>Prax didn’t know he was going to speak until he heard his own voice. He sounded whiny.</p>\n<p>“My daughter’s in the eighth level. Her school’s down there.”</p>\n<p>“Every level is in lockdown, sir,” the soldier said. “She’ll be just fine. You just have to be patient.”</p>\n<p>The dark-skinned woman from the transportation board crossed her arms. Prax saw two men abandon the press, walking back down the narrow, dirty hall, talking to each other. In the old tunnels this far up, the air smelled of recyclers—plastic and heat and artificial scents. And now also of fear.</p>\n<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” the soldier shouted. “For your own safety, you need to remain calm and stay where you are until the military situation has been resolved.”</p>\n<p>“What exactly is the military situation?” a woman at Prax’s elbow said, her voice making the words a demand.</p>\n<p>“It’s rapidly evolving,” the soldier said. Prax thought there was a dangerous buzz in her voice. She was as scared as anyone. Only she had a gun. So this wasn’t going to work. He had to find something else. His one remaining <em>Glycine kenon</em> still in his hand, Prax walked away from the tube station.</p>\n<p>He’d been eight years old when his father had transferred from the high-population centers of Europa to help build a research lab on Ganymede. The construction had taken ten years, during which Prax had gone through a rocky adolescence. When his parents had packed up to move the family to a new contract on an asteroid in eccentric orbit near Neptune, Prax had stayed behind. He’d gotten a botany internship thinking that he could use it to grow illicit, untaxed marijuana only to discover that every third botany intern had come in with the same plan. The four years he’d spent trying to find a forgotten closet or an abandoned tunnel that wasn’t already occupied by an illegal hydroponics experiment left him with a good sense of the tunnel architecture.</p>\n<p>He walked through the old, narrow hallways of the first-generation construction. Men and women sat along the walls or in the bars and restaurants, their faces blank or angry or frightened. The display screens were set on old entertainment loops of music or theater or abstract art instead of the usual newsfeeds. No hand terminals chimed with incoming messages.</p>\n<p>By the central-air ducts, he found what he’d been looking for. The maintenance transport always had a few old electric scooters lying around. No one used them anymore. Because Prax was a senior researcher, his hand terminal would let him through the rusting chain-link fencing. He found one scooter with a sidecar and half a charge still in the batteries. It had been seven years since he’d been on a scooter. He put the <em>Glycine kenon</em> in the sidecar, ran through the diagnostic sequence, and wheeled himself out to the hall.</p>\n<p>The first three ramps had soldiers just like the ones he’d seen at the tube station. Prax didn’t bother stopping. At the fourth, a supply tunnel that led from the surface warehouses down toward the reactors, there was nobody. He paused, the scooter silent beneath him. There was a bright acid smell in the air that he couldn’t quite place. Slowly, other details registered. The scorch marks at the wall panel, a smear of something dark along the floor. He heard a distant popping sound that it took three or four long breaths to recognize as gunfire.</p>\n<p><em>Rapidly evolving</em> apparently meant fighting in the tunnels. The image of Mei’s classroom stippled with bullet holes and soaked in children’s blood popped into his mind, as vivid as something he was remembering instead of imagining. The panic he’d felt in the dome came down on him again, but a hundred times worse.</p>\n<p>“She’s fine,” he told the plant beside him. “They wouldn’t have a firefight in a day care. There’re kids there.”</p>\n<p>The green-black leaves were already starting to wilt. They wouldn’t have a war around children. Or food supplies. Or fragile agricultural domes. His hands were trembling again, but not so badly he couldn’t steer.</p>\n<p>The first explosion came just as he was heading down the ramp from seven to level eight along the side of one of the cathedral-huge unfinished caverns where the raw ice of the moon had been left to weep and refreeze, something between a massive green space and a work of art. There was a flash, then a concussion, and the scooter was fishtailing. The wall loomed up fast, and Prax wrenched his leg out of the way before the impact. Above him, he heard voices shouting. Combat troops would be in armor, talking through their radios. At least, he thought they would. The people screaming up there had to be just people. A second explosion gouged the cavern wall, a section of blue-white ice the size of a tractor calving off the roof and falling slowly and inexorably down to the floor, grinding into it. Prax scrambled to keep the scooter upright. His heart felt like it was trying to break out of his rib cage.</p>\n<p>On the upper edge of the curving ramp, he saw figures in armor. He didn’t know if they were UN or Mars. One of them turned toward him, lifting a rifle. Prax gunned the scooter, sliding fast down the ramp. The chatter of automatic weapons and the smell of smoke and steam melt followed him.</p>\n<p>The school’s doors were closed. He didn’t know if that was ominous or hopeful. He brought the wobbling scooter to a halt, jumped off. His legs felt weak and unsteady. He meant to knock gently on the steel drop door, but his first try split the skin over his knuckle.</p>\n<p>“Open up! My daughter’s in there!” He sounded like a madman, but someone inside heard him or saw him on the security monitor. The articulated steel plates of the door shuddered and began to rise. Prax dropped to the ground and scrambled through.</p>\n<p>He hadn’t met the new teacher, Miss Carrie, more than a few times, when dropping Mei off or picking her up. She couldn’t have been more than twenty years old and was Belter-tall and thin. He didn’t remember her face being so gray.</p>\n<p>The schoolroom was intact, though. The children were in a circle, singing a song about an ant traveling through the solar system, with rhymes for all the major asteroid bodies. There was no blood, no bullet holes, but the smell of burning plastic was seeping through the vents. He had to get Mei someplace safe. He wasn’t sure where that would be. He looked at the circle of children, trying to pick out her face, her hair.</p>\n<p>“Mei’s not here, sir,” Miss Carrie said, her voice tight and breathy at the same time. “Her mother got her this morning.”</p>\n<p>“This morning?” Prax said, but his mind fastened on <em>her mother</em>. What was Nicola doing on Ganymede? He’d had a message from her two days earlier about the child support judgment; she <em>couldn’t</em> have gotten from Ceres to Ganymede in two days…</p>\n<p>“Just after snack,” the teacher said.</p>\n<p>“You mean she was evacuated. Someone came and evacuated Mei.”</p>\n<p>Another explosion came, shaking the ice. One of the children made a high, frightened sound. The teacher looked from him to the children, then back. When she spoke again, her voice was lower.</p>\n<p>“Her mother came just after snack. She took Mei with her. She hasn’t been here all day.”</p>\n<p>Prax pulled up his hand terminal. The connection was still dead, but his wallpaper was a picture from Mei’s first birthday, back when things were still good. Lifetimes ago. He held up the picture and pointed at Nicola, laughing and dangling the doughy, delighted bundle that had been Mei.</p>\n<p>“Her?” Prax said. “ <em>She</em> was here?”</p>\n<p>The confusion in the teacher’s face answered him. There’d been a mistake. Someone—a new nanny or a social worker or something—had come to pick up a kid and gotten the wrong one.</p>\n<p>“She was on the computer,” the teacher said. “She was in the system. It <em>showed</em> her.”</p>\n<p>The lights flickered. The smell of smoke was getting stronger, and the air recyclers were humming loudly, popping and crackling as they struggled to suck out the volatile particulates. A boy whose name Prax should have known whimpered, and the teacher reflexively tried to turn toward him. Prax took her elbow and wrenched her back.</p>\n<p>“No, you made a mistake,” he said. “Who did you give Mei to?”</p>\n<p>“The system said it was her mother! She had identification. It cleared her.”</p>\n<p>A stutter of muted gunfire came from the hallway. Someone was screaming outside, and then the kids started to shriek. The teacher pulled her arm away. Something banged against the drop door.</p>\n<p>“She was about thirty. Dark hair, dark eyes. She had a doctor with her, she was in the system, and Mei didn’t make any kind of fuss about it.”</p>\n<p>“Did they take her medicine?” he asked. “Did they take her <em>medicine</em>?”</p>\n<p>“No. I don’t know. I don’t think so.”</p>\n<p>Without meaning to, Prax shook the woman. Only once, but hard. If Mei didn’t have her medicine, she’d already missed her midday dose. She might make it as long as morning before her immune system started shutting down.</p>\n<p>“Show me,” Prax said. “Show me the picture. The woman who took her.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t! The system’s down!” the teacher shouted. “They’re killing people in the hallway!”</p>\n<p>The circle of children dissolved, screams riding on the backs of screams. The teacher was crying, her hands pressed to her face. Her skin had an almost blue cast to it. He could feel the raw animal panic leaping through his brain. The calm that fell on him didn’t take away from it.</p>\n<p>“Is there an evacuation tunnel?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“They told us to stay here,” the teacher said.</p>\n<p>“I’m telling you to evacuate,” Prax said, but what he thought was <em>I have to find Mei</em>.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Four: Bobbie</h2>\n<p>Consciousness returned as an angry buzzing noise and pain. Bobbie blinked once, trying to clear her head, trying to see where she was. Her vision was maddeningly blurry. The buzzing sound resolved into an alarm from her suit. Colored lights flashed in her face as the suit’s HUD sent her data she couldn’t read. It was in the middle of rebooting and alarms were coming on one by one. She tried to move her arms and found that although weak, she wasn’t paralyzed or frozen in place. The impact gel in her suit had returned to a liquid state.</p>\n<p>Something moved across the window of faint light that was her helmet’s face shield. A head, bobbing in and out of view. Then a click as someone plugged a hardline into her suit’s external port. A corpsman, then, downloading her injury data.</p>\n<p>A voice, male and young, in her suit’s internal speakers said, “Gotcha, Gunny. We gotcha. Gonna be okay. Gonna be all right. Just hang in there.”</p>\n<p>He hadn’t quite finished saying <em>there</em> when she blacked out again.</p>\n<p>She woke bouncing down a long white tunnel on a stretcher. She wasn’t wearing her suit anymore. Bobbie was afraid that the battlefield med-techs hadn’t wasted time taking her out of it the normal way, that they’d just hit the override that blew all the seams and joints apart. It was a fast way to get a wounded soldier out of four hundred kilos of armored exoskeleton, but the suit was destroyed in the process. Bobbie felt a pang of remorse for the loss of her faithful old suit.</p>\n<p>A moment later, she remembered that her entire platoon had been ripped to pieces before her eyes, and her sadness about the lost suit seemed trivial and demeaning.</p>\n<p>A hard bump on the stretcher sent a jolt of lightning up her spine and hurled her back into darkness.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant Draper,” a voice said.</p>\n<p>Bobbie tried to open her eyes and found it impossible to do. Each eyelid weighed a thousand kilos, and even the attempt left her exhausted. So she tried to answer the voice and was surprised and a little ashamed of the drunken mumble that came out instead.</p>\n<p>“She’s conscious, but just barely,” the voice said. It was a deep, mellow male voice. It seemed filled with warmth and concern. Bobbie hoped that the voice would keep talking until she fell back asleep.</p>\n<p>A second voice, female and sharp, replied, “Let her rest. Trying to bring her fully awake right now is dangerous.”</p>\n<p>The kind voice said, “I don’t care if it kills her, Doctor. I need to speak to this soldier, and I need to do it now. So you give her whatever you need to give her to make that happen.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie smiled to herself, not parsing the words the nice voice said, just the kindly, warm tone. It was good to have someone like that to take care of you. She started to fall back asleep, the coming blackness a welcome friend.</p>\n<p>White fire shot up Bobbie’s spine, and she sat bolt upright in bed, as awake as she’d ever been. It felt like going on the juice, the chemical cocktail they gave sailors to keep them conscious and alert during high-g maneuvers. Bobbie opened her eyes and then slammed them shut again when the room’s bright white light nearly burned them out of her sockets.</p>\n<p>“Turn off the lights,” she mumbled, the words coming out of her dry throat in a whisper.</p>\n<p>The red light seeping in through her closed eyelids dimmed, but when she tried to open them again, it was still too bright. Someone took her hand and held it while a cup was put into it.</p>\n<p>“Can you hold that?” the nice voice said.</p>\n<p>Bobbie didn’t answer; she just brought the cup to her mouth and drank the water in two greedy swallows.</p>\n<p>“More,” she said, this time in something resembling her old voice.</p>\n<p>She heard the sounds of someone scooting a chair and then footsteps away from her on a tile floor. Her brief look at the room had told her she was in a hospital. She could hear the electric hum of medical machines nearby, and the smells of antiseptic and urine competed for dominance. Disheartened, she realized she was the source of the urine smell. A faucet ran for a moment, and then the footsteps came toward her. The cup was put back into her hand. She sipped at it this time, letting the water stay in her mouth awhile before swallowing. It was cool and delicious.</p>\n<p>When she was finished, the voice asked, “More?”</p>\n<p>She shook her head.</p>\n<p>“Maybe later,” she said. Then, after a moment: “Am I blind?”</p>\n<p>“No. You’ve been given a combination of focus drugs and powerful amphetamines. Which means your eyes are fully dilated. Sorry, I didn’t think to lower the lights before you woke up.”</p>\n<p>The voice was still filled with kindness and warmth. Bobbie wanted to see the face behind that voice, so she risked squinting through one eye. The light didn’t burn into her like it had before, but it was still uncomfortable. The owner of the nice voice turned out to be a very tall, thin man in a naval intelligence uniform. His face was narrow and tight, the skull beneath it pressing to get out. He gave her a frightening smile that didn’t extend past a slight upturn at the corners of his mouth.</p>\n<p>“Gunnery Sergeant Roberta W. Draper, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force,” he said, his voice so at odds with his appearance that Bobbie felt like she was watching a movie dubbed from a foreign language.</p>\n<p>After several seconds, he still hadn’t continued, so Bobbie said, “Yes, sir,” then glanced at his bars and added, “Captain.”</p>\n<p>She could open both eyes now without pain, but a strange tingling sensation was moving up her limbs, making them feel numb and shaky at the same time. She resisted an urge to fidget.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant Draper, my name is Captain Thorsson, and I am here to debrief you. We’ve lost your entire platoon. There’s been a two-day pitched battle between the United Nations and Martian Congressional Republic forces on Ganymede. Which, at most recent tally, has resulted in over five billion MCR dollars of infrastructure damage, and the deaths of nearly three thousand military and civilian personnel.”</p>\n<p>He paused again, staring at her through narrowed eyes that glittered like a snake’s. Not sure what response he was looking for, Bobbie just said, “Yes, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Sergeant Draper, why did your platoon fire on and destroy the UN military outpost at dome fourteen?”</p>\n<p>This question was so nonsensical that Bobbie’s mind spent several seconds trying to figure out what it really meant.</p>\n<p>“Who ordered you to commence firing, and why?”</p>\n<p>Of course he couldn’t be asking why her people had started the fight. Didn’t he know about the monster?</p>\n<p>“Don’t you know about the monster?”</p>\n<p>Captain Thorsson didn’t move, but the corners of his mouth dropped into a frown, and his forehead bunched up over his nose.</p>\n<p>“Monster,” he said, none of the warmth gone from his voice.</p>\n<p>“Sir, some kind of monster… mutant… something attacked the UN outpost. The UN troops were running to us to escape it. We didn’t fire on them. This… this whatever it was killed them, and then it killed us,” she said, nauseated and pausing to swallow at the lemony taste in her mouth. “I mean, everyone but me.”</p>\n<p>Thorsson frowned for a moment, then reached into one pocket and took out a small digital recorder. He turned it off, then set it on a tray next to Bobbie’s bed.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant, I’m going to give you a second chance. Up to now, your record has been exemplary. You are a fine marine. One of our best. Would you like to start over?”</p>\n<p>He picked up the recorder and placed a finger on the delete button while giving her a knowing look.</p>\n<p>“You think I’m lying?” she said. The itchy feeling in her limbs resolved itself into a very real urge to reach out and snap the smug bastard’s arm off at the elbow. “We all shot at it. There will be gun camera footage from the entire platoon of this thing killing UN soldiers and then attacking us. Sir.”</p>\n<p>Thorsson shook his hatchet-shaped head at her, narrowing his eyes until they almost disappeared.</p>\n<p>“We have no transmissions from the platoon for the entire fight, and no uploaded data—”</p>\n<p>“They were jamming,” Bobbie interrupted. “I lost my radio link when I got close to the monster too.”</p>\n<p>Thorsson continued as though she had not spoken. “And all of the local hardware was lost when an orbital mirror array fell onto the dome. You were outside of the impact area, but the shock wave threw you nearly another quarter of a kilometer. It took us some time to find you.”</p>\n<p><em>All of the local hardware was lost</em>. Such a sterile way of putting it. Everyone in Bobbie’s platoon blown into shrapnel and vapor when a couple thousand tons of mirror fell out of orbit onto them. A monitor started sounding a low, chiming alert, but no one else paid it any attention, so she didn’t either.</p>\n<p>“My suit, sir. I shot at it too. My video will still be there.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Thorsson said. “We’ve examined your suit’s video log. It’s nothing but static.”</p>\n<p><em>This is like a bad horror movie</em> , she thought. The heroine who sees the monster, but no one will believe her. She imagined the second act, in which she was court-martialed in disgrace, and only got her redemption in the third act, when the monster showed up again and killed everyone who didn’t believe—</p>\n<p>“Wait!” she said. “What decompression did you use? My suit is an older model. It uses the version 5.1 video compression. Tell the tech that, and have them try it again.”</p>\n<p>Thorsson stared at her for a few moments, then pulled out his hand terminal and called someone.</p>\n<p>“Have Sergeant Draper’s combat suit brought up to her room. Send a tech with video gear with it.”</p>\n<p>He put the terminal away and then gave Bobbie another of those frightening smiles.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant, I admit that I am extremely curious about what you want me to see. If this is still a ruse of some kind, you’ve only bought yourself a few more moments.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie didn’t reply, but her reaction to Thorsson’s attitude had finally shifted from frightened through angry to annoyed. She pushed herself up in the narrow hospital bed and turned sideways, sitting on the edge and tossing the blanket to the side. With her size, her physical presence up close usually either frightened men or turned them on. Either way it made them uncomfortable. She leaned toward Thorsson a bit and was rewarded when he pushed his chair back an equal amount.</p>\n<p>She could tell from his disgusted expression that he immediately knew what she’d done, and he looked away from her smile.</p>\n<p>The door to the room opened and a pair of Navy techs wheeled in her suit on a rack. It was intact. They hadn’t wrecked it taking her out. She felt a lump come up in her throat, and swallowed it back down. She wasn’t going to show even a moment’s weakness in front of this Thorsson clown.</p>\n<p>The clown pointed at the senior of the two techs and said, “You. What’s your name?”</p>\n<p>The young tech snapped off a salute and said, “Petty Officer Electrician’s Mate Singh, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Singh, Sergeant Draper here is claiming that her suit has a different video compression than the new suits, and that’s why you were unable to read her video data. Is this correct?”</p>\n<p>Singh slapped himself on the forehead with his palm.</p>\n<p>“Shit. Yeah,” he said. “I didn’t think—This is the old Mark III Goliath suit. When they started making the Mark IV, they completely rewrote the firmware. Totally different video storage system. Wow, I feel pretty stupid—”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” interrupted Thorsson. “Do whatever you need to do to display the video stored on that suit. The sooner you do, the less time I will have to dwell on the delays caused by incompetence.”</p>\n<p>Singh, to his credit, did not reply. He immediately plugged the suit into a monitor and began working. Bobbie examined her suit. It had a lot of scratches and dings but appeared otherwise undamaged. She felt a strong urge to go put it on and then tell Thorsson where he could stick his attitude.</p>\n<p>A new set of shakes moved up her arms and legs. Something fluttered in her neck like the heartbeat of a small animal. She reached up and touched it. It was her pulse. She started to say something, but the tech was pumping his fist and high-fiving his assistant.</p>\n<p>“Got it, sir,” Singh said, then began the playback.</p>\n<p>Bobbie tried to watch, but the picture kept getting fuzzy. She reached for Thorsson’s arm to get his attention, but missed somehow and just kept tipping forward.</p>\n<p><em>Here we go again</em> , she thought, and there was a brief moment of free fall before the blackness.</p>\n<p>“God dammit,” the sharp voice said. “I goddamn well told you this would happen. This soldier has suffered internal injuries and a nasty concussion. You can’t just pump her full of speed and then interrogate her. It’s irresponsible. It’s fucking criminal!”</p>\n<p>Bobbie opened her eyes. She was back in bed. Thorsson sat in the chair by her side. A stocky blond woman in hospital scrubs stood at the foot of her bed, her face flushed and furious. When she saw Bobbie was awake, she moved to her side and took her hand.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant Draper, don’t try to move. You took a fall and aggravated some of your injuries. We’ve got you stabilized, but you need to rest now.”</p>\n<p>The doctor looked up at Thorsson as she said it, her face placing exclamation marks after every sentence. Bobbie nodded at her, which made her head feel like a bowl of water being carried in shifting gravity. That it didn’t hurt probably meant they’d shot her full of every pain medication they had.</p>\n<p>“Sergeant Draper’s assistance was crucial,” Thorsson said, not a hint of apology in his lovely voice. “Because of it, she may have just saved us from an all-out shooting war with Earth. Risking one’s own life so others don’t have to is pretty much the definition of Roberta’s job.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t call me Roberta,” Bobbie mumbled.</p>\n<p>“Gunny,” Thorsson said. “I’m sorry about what happened to your team. But mostly I’m sorry for not believing you. Thank you for responding with professionalism. We avoided a serious mistake because of it.”</p>\n<p>“Just thought you were an asshole,” Bobbie said.</p>\n<p>“That’s my job, soldier.”</p>\n<p>Thorsson stood up. “Get some rest. We’re shipping you out as soon as you’re well enough for the trip.”</p>\n<p>“Shipping me out? Back to Mars?”</p>\n<p>Thorsson didn’t answer. He nodded to the doctor, then left. The doctor pushed a button on one of the machines near Bobbie’s bed, and something cool shot into her arm. The lights went out.</p>\n<p><em>Gelatin. Why do hospitals always serve gelatin?</em></p>\n<p>Bobbie desultorily poked her spork at the quivering mound of green on her plate. She was finally feeling good enough to really eat, and the soft and see-through foods they kept bringing her were growing more unsatisfying. Even the high-protein, high-carbohydrate slop they cranked out on most Navy ships sounded good right then. Or a thick mushroom steak covered in gravy with a side of couscous…</p>\n<p>The door to her room slid open and her doctor, who she now knew was named Trisha Pichon but who insisted that everyone call her Dr. Trish, came in along with Captain Thorsson and a new man she didn’t know. Thorsson gave her his creepy smile, but Bobbie had learned that it was just the way the man’s face worked. He seemed to lack the muscles necessary for normal smiling. The new man wore a Marine chaplain’s uniform of indeterminate religious affiliation.</p>\n<p>Dr. Trish spoke first.</p>\n<p>“Good news, Bobbie. We’re turning you loose tomorrow. How do you feel?”</p>\n<p>“Fine. Hungry,” Bobbie said, then gave her gelatin another stab.</p>\n<p>“We’ll see about getting you some real food, then,” Dr. Trish said, then smiled and left the room.</p>\n<p>Thorsson pointed at the chaplain. “This is Captain Martens. He’ll be coming with us on our trip. I’ll leave you two to get acquainted.”</p>\n<p>Thorsson left before Bobbie could respond, and Martens plopped himself down in the chair next to her bed. He stuck out his hand, and she shook it.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Sergeant,” he said. “I—”</p>\n<p>“When I marked my 2790 form as ‘none’ for religious faith, I was serious about that,” Bobbie said, cutting him off.</p>\n<p>Martens smiled, apparently not offended by her interruption or her agnosticism.</p>\n<p>“I’m not here in a religious capacity, Sergeant. I’m also a trained grief counselor, and since you witnessed the death of every person in your unit, and were almost killed yourself, Captain Thorsson and your doctor agree that you might need me.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie started to make a dismissive reply, which was cut off by the lump in her chest. She hid her discomfort by taking a long drink of water, then said, “I’m fine. Thanks for coming by.”</p>\n<p>Martens leaned back in the chair, his smile never wavering.</p>\n<p>“If you were really all right after what you’ve been through, it would be a sign that something was wrong. And you’re about to be thrown into a situation with a lot of emotional and intellectual pressure. Once we get to Earth, you won’t have the luxury of having an emotional breakdown or post-traumatic stress responses. We have a lot of work to—”</p>\n<p>“Earth?” Bobbie pounced on the word. “Waitaminute. Why am I going to <em>Earth</em>?”</p>\n<h2>Chapter Five: Avasarala</h2>\n<p>Chrisjen Avasarala, assistant to the undersecretary of executive administration, sat near the end of the table. Her sari was orange, the only splash of color in the otherwise military blue-and-gray of the meeting. The seven others with seats at the table were the heads of their respective branches of the United Nations military forces, all of them men. She knew their names, their career paths and psychological profiles, pay rates and political alliances and who they were sleeping with. Against the back wall, personal assistants and staff pages stood in uncomfortable stillness, like the shy teenagers at a dance. Avasarala snuck a pistachio out of her purse, cracked the shell discreetly, and popped the salted nut into her mouth.</p>\n<p>“Any meeting with Martian command is going to have to wait until after the situation on Ganymede is stabilized. Official diplomatic talks before then are only going to make it seem like we’ve accepted the new status quo.” That was Admiral Nguyen, youngest of the men present. Hawkish. Impressed with himself in the way that successful young men tended to be.</p>\n<p>General Adiki-Sandoval nodded his bull-wide head.</p>\n<p>“Agreed. It’s not just Mars we need to think about here. If we start looking weak to the Outer Planets Alliance, you can count on a spike in terrorist activity.”</p>\n<p>Mikel Agee, from the diplomatic corps, leaned back on his chair and licked his lips anxiously. His slicked-back hair and pinched face made him look like an anthropomorphic rat.</p>\n<p>“Gentlemen, I have to disagree—”</p>\n<p>“Of course you do,” General Nettleford said dryly. Agee ignored him.</p>\n<p>“Meeting with Mars at this point is a necessary first step. If we start throwing around preconditions and obstacles, not only is this process going to take longer, but the chances for renewed hostilities go up. If we can take the pressure off, blow off some steam—”</p>\n<p>Admiral Nguyen nodded, his face expressionless. When he spoke, his tone was conversational.</p>\n<p>“You guys over at Dip have any metaphors more recent than the steam engine?”</p>\n<p>Avasarala chuckled with the others. She didn’t think much of Agee either.</p>\n<p>“Mars has already escalated,” General Nettleford said. “Seems to me our best move at this point is to pull the Seventh back from Ceres Station. Get them burning. Put a ticking clock on the wall, then see if the Martians want to stand back on Ganymede.”</p>\n<p>“Are you talking about moving them to the Jovian system?” Nguyen asked. “Or are you taking them in toward Mars?”</p>\n<p>“Taking something in toward Earth looks a lot like taking it in toward Mars,” Nettleford said.</p>\n<p>Avasarala cleared her throat.</p>\n<p>“Do you have anything new on the initial attacker?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“The tech guys are working on it,” Nettleford said. “But that makes my point. If Mars is testing out new technologies on Ganymede, we can’t afford to let them control the tempo. We have to get a threat of our own on the board.”</p>\n<p>“It was the protomolecule, though?” Agee asked. “I mean, it was whatever was on Eros when it went down?”</p>\n<p>“Working on that,” Nettleford said again, biting at the words a little. “There are some gross similarities, but there’s some basic differences too. It didn’t spread the way it did on Eros. Ganymede isn’t changing the way the population of Eros did. From the satellite imagery we’ve got, it looks like it went to Martian territory and either self-destructed or was disposed of by their side. If it’s related to Eros at all, it’s been refined.”</p>\n<p>“So Mars got a sample and weaponized it,” Admiral Souther said. He didn’t talk much. Avasarala always forgot how high his voice was.</p>\n<p>“One possibility,” Nettleford said. “One very strong possibility.”</p>\n<p>“Look,” Nguyen said with a self-satisfied little smile, like a child who knew he was going to get his way. “I know we’ve taken first strike off the table here, but we need to talk about what the limits are on immediate response. If this was a dry run for something bigger, waiting may be as good as walking out an airlock.”</p>\n<p>“We should take the meeting with Mars,” Avasarala said.</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Nguyen’s face darkened.</p>\n<p>“Is that…” he said, but never finished the sentence. Avasarala watched the men look at each other. She took another pistachio from her purse, ate the meat, and tucked the shells away. Agee tried not to look pleased. She really did need to find out who had pulled strings to have him represent the diplomatic corps. He was a terrible choice.</p>\n<p>“Security’s going to be a problem,” Nettleford said. “We’re not letting any of their ships inside our effective defense perimeter.”</p>\n<p>“Well, we can’t have it on their terms. If we’re going to do this, we want them here, where we control the ground.”</p>\n<p>“Park them a safe distance away, and have our transports pick them up?”</p>\n<p>“They’ll never agree to that.”</p>\n<p>“So let’s find out what they will agree to.”</p>\n<p>Avasarala quietly stood up and headed for the door. Her personal assistant—a European boy named Soren Cottwald—detached himself from the back wall and followed her. The generals pretended not to notice her exit, or maybe they were so wrapped up in the new set of problems she’d handed them, they really didn’t. Either way, she was sure they were as pleased to have her out as she was to leave.</p>\n<p>The hallways of the United Nations complex in the Hague were clean and wide, the décor a soft style that made everything look like a museum diorama of Portuguese colonies in the 1940s. She paused at an organics recycling unit and started digging the shells out of her bag.</p>\n<p>“What’s next?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Debriefing with Mr. Errinwright.”</p>\n<p>“After that?”</p>\n<p>“Meeston Gravis about the Afghanistan problem.”</p>\n<p>“Cancel it.”</p>\n<p>“What should I tell him?”</p>\n<p>Avasarala dusted her hands over the waste container, then turned, walking briskly toward the central commons and the elevators.</p>\n<p>“Fuck him,” she said. “Tell him the Afghanis have been resisting external rule since before my ancestors were kicking out the British. As soon as I figure out how to change that, I’ll let him know.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>\n<p>“I also need an updated summary paper on Venus. The latest. And I don’t have time to get another PhD to read it, so if it’s not in clear, concise language, fire the sonofabitch and get someone who knows how to write.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>\n<p>The elevator that rose from the common lobby and meeting rooms up to the offices glittered like spun diamond set in steel and was big enough to seat dinner for four. It recognized them as they stepped in, and began its careful rise through the levels. Outside the windows of the common areas, the Binnenhof seemed to sink and the huge anthill of buildings that was the Hague spread out under a perfect blue sky. It was springtime, and the snow that had touched the city since December was finally gone. The pigeons swirled up from the streets far below. There were thirty billion people on the planet, but they would never crowd out the pigeons.</p>\n<p>“They’re all fucking men,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Excuse me?” Soren said.</p>\n<p>“The generals. They’re all fucking men.”</p>\n<p>“I thought Souther was the only—”</p>\n<p>“I don’t mean that they all fuck men. I mean they’re all men, the fuckers. How long has it been since a woman was in charge of the armed forces? Not since I came here. So instead, we wind up with another example of what happens to policy when there’s too much testosterone in the room. That reminds me: Get in touch with Annette Rabbir in infrastructure. I don’t trust Nguyen. If traffic starts going up between him and anyone in the general assembly, I want to know it.”</p>\n<p>Soren cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>“Excuse me, ma’am. Did you just instruct me to spy on Admiral Nguyen?”</p>\n<p>“No, I just asked for a comprehensive audit of all network traffic, and I don’t give a fuck about any results besides Nguyen’s office.”</p>\n<p>“Of course. My mistake.”</p>\n<p>The elevator rose past the windows, past the view of the city, and into the dark shaft of the private-office levels. Avasarala cracked her knuckles.</p>\n<p>“Just in case, though,” she said, “do it on your own initiative.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, ma’am. That was my thought too.”</p>\n<p>To those who knew Avasarala only by reputation, her office was deceptively unassuming. It was on the east side of the building, where the lower-ranked officials usually started out. She had a window looking out over the city, but not a corner. The video screen that took up most of the southern wall was left off when it wasn’t in active use, leaving it matte black. The other walls were scuffed bamboo paneling. The carpet was industrially short and patterned to hide stains. The only decorations were a small shrine with a clay sculpture of the Gautama Buddha beside the desk, and a cut crystal vase with the flowers that her husband, Arjun, sent every Thursday. The place smelled like fresh blooms and old pipe smoke, though Avasarala had never smoked there and didn’t know anyone who had. She walked to the window. Beneath her, the city spread out in vast concrete and ancient stone.</p>\n<p>In the darkening sky, Venus burned.</p>\n<p>In the twelve years she had been at this desk, in this room, everything had changed. The alliance between Earth and its upstart brother had been an eternal, unshakable thing once. The Belt had been an annoyance and a haven for tiny cells of renegades and troublemakers as likely to die of a ship malfunction as to be called to justice. Humanity had been alone in the universe.</p>\n<p>And then the secret discovery that Phoebe, idiosyncratic moon of Saturn, had been an alien weapon, launched at earth when life here was hardly more than an interesting idea wrapped in a lipid bilayer. How could anything be the same after that?</p>\n<p>And yet it was. Yes, Earth and Mars were still unsure whether they were permanent allies or deadly enemies. Yes, the OPA, Hezbollah of the vacuum, was on its way to being a real political force in the outer planets. Yes, the thing that had been meant to reshape the primitive biosphere of Earth had instead ridden a rogue asteroid down into the clouds of Venus and started doing no one knew what.</p>\n<p>But the spring still came. The election cycle still rose and fell. The evening star still lit the indigo heavens, outshining even the greatest cities of Earth.</p>\n<p>Other days, she found that reassuring.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Errinwright,” Soren said.</p>\n<p>Avasarala turned to the dead screen on her wall as it came to life. Sadavir Errinwright was darker skinned than she was, his face round and soft. It would have been in place anywhere in the Punjab, but his voice affected the cool, analytic amusement of Britain. He wore a dark suit and a smart, narrow tie. Wherever he was, it was bright daylight behind him. The link kept fluttering, trying to balance the bright with the dark, leaving him a shadow in a government office or else a man haloed by light.</p>\n<p>“Your meeting went well, I hope?”</p>\n<p>“It was fine,” she said. “We’re moving ahead with the Martian summit. They’re working out the security arrangements now.”</p>\n<p>“That was the consensus?”</p>\n<p>“Once I told them it was, yes. The Martians are sending their top men to a meeting with officials of the United Nations to personally deliver their apology and discuss how to normalize relations and return Ganymede to blah blah blah. Yes?”</p>\n<p>Errinwright scratched his chin.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure that’s how our opposites on Mars see it,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Then they can protest. We’ll send out dueling press releases and threaten to cancel the meeting right up to the last minute. High drama is wonderful. It’s better than wonderful; it’s distracting. Just don’t let the bobble-head talk about Venus or Eros.”</p>\n<p>His flinch was almost subliminal.</p>\n<p>“Please, can we not refer to the secretary-general as ‘the bobble-head’?”</p>\n<p>“Why not? He knows I do. I say it to his face, and he doesn’t mind.”</p>\n<p>“He thinks you’re joking.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because he’s a fucking bobble-head. Don’t let him talk about Venus.”</p>\n<p>“And the footage?”</p>\n<p>It was a fair question. Whatever had made its attack on Ganymede, it had started in the area held by the United Nations. If the back-channel chatter was to be trusted—and it wasn’t—Mars had a lone marine’s suit camera. Avasarala had seven minutes of high-definition video from forty different cameras of the thing slaughtering the best people Earth had standing for it. Even if the Martians could be convinced to keep it quiet, this was going to be hard to bury.</p>\n<p>“Give me until the meeting,” Avasarala said. “Let me see what they say and how they say it. Then I’ll know what to do. If it’s a Martian weapon, they’ll show it by what they bring to the table.”</p>\n<p>“I see,” Errinwright said slowly. Meaning he didn’t.</p>\n<p>“Sir, with all respect,” she said, “for the time being, this needs to be something between Earth and Mars.”</p>\n<p>“High drama between the two major military forces in the system is what we want? How exactly do you see that?”</p>\n<p>“I got an alert from Michael-Jon de Uturbé about increased activity on Venus at the <em>same time</em> the shooting started on Ganymede. It wasn’t a big spike, but it was there. And Venus getting restless just when something happens that looks a damn lot like the protomolecule showed up on Ganymede? That’s a problem.”</p>\n<p>She let that sink in for a moment before she went on. Errinwright’s eyes shifted, like he was reading in the air. It was something he did when he was thinking hard.</p>\n<p>“Saber rattling we’ve done before,” she said. “We’ve survived it. It’s a known quantity. I have a binder with nine hundred pages of analysis and contingency plans for conflict with Mars, including fourteen different scenarios about what we do if they develop an unexpected new technology. The binder for what we do if something comes up from Venus? It’s three pages long, and it begins <em>Step One: Find God</em>.”</p>\n<p>Errinwright looked sober. She could hear Soren behind her, a different and more anxious silence than he usually carried. She’d laid her fear out on the table.</p>\n<p>“Three options,” she said softly. “One: Mars made it. That’s just war. We can handle that. Two: Someone else made it. Unpleasant and dangerous, but solvable. Three: It made itself. And we don’t have anything.”</p>\n<p>“You’re going to put more pages in your thin binder?” Errinwright said. He sounded flippant. He wasn’t.</p>\n<p>“No, sir. I’m going to find out which of the three we’re looking at. If it’s one of the first two, I’ll solve the problem.”</p>\n<p>“And if the third?”</p>\n<p>“Retire,” she said. “Let you put some other idiot in charge.”</p>\n<p>Errinwright had known her long enough to hear the joke in her voice. He smiled and tugged absently at his tie. It was a tell of his. He was as anxious as she was. No one who didn’t know him would have seen it.</p>\n<p>“That’s a tightrope. We can’t let the conflict on Ganymede become too heated.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll keep it a sideshow,” Avasarala said. “No one starts a war unless I say they can.”</p>\n<p>“You mean unless the secretary-general issues the executive decision and the general assembly casts an affirming vote.”</p>\n<p>“And I’ll tell him when he can do that,” she said. “But you can give him the news. Hearing it from an old grandma like me makes his dick shrink.”</p>\n<p>“Well, we can’t have that, certainly. Let me know what you find. I’ll speak with the speech-writing staff and make certain that the text of his announcement doesn’t color outside the lines.”</p>\n<p>“And anyone who leaks the video of the attack answers to me,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Anyone who leaks it is guilty of treason and will be tried before a legitimate tribunal and sent to the Lunar Penal Colony for life.”</p>\n<p>“Close enough.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be a stranger, Chrisjen. We’re in difficult times. The fewer surprises, the better.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” she said. The link died. The screen went dark. She could see herself in it as a smudge of orange topped by the gray of her hair. Soren was a blur of khaki and white.</p>\n<p>“You need more work?”</p>\n<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>\n<p>“So get the fuck out.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>\n<p>She heard his footsteps retreating behind her.</p>\n<p>“Soren!”</p>\n<p>“Ma’am?”</p>\n<p>“Get me a list of everyone who testified at the Eros incident hearings. And run what they said in testimony past the neuropsych analysts if it hasn’t already been.”</p>\n<p>“Would you like the transcripts?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that too.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll have them to you as soon as possible.”</p>\n<p>The door closed behind him, and Avasarala sank into her chair. Her feet hurt, and the presentiment of a headache that had haunted her since morning was stepping forward, clearing its throat. The Buddha smiled serenely, and she chuckled at him, as if sharing a private joke. She wanted to go home, to sit on her porch and listen to Arjun practice his piano.</p>\n<p>And instead…</p>\n<p>She used her hand terminal rather than the office system to call Arjun. It was a superstitious urge that made her want to keep them separate, even in ways as small as this. He picked up the connection at once. His face was angular, the close-cut beard almost entirely white now. The merriness in his eyes was always there, even when he wept. Just looking at him, she felt something in her breast relax.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to be late coming home,” she said, immediately regretting the matter-of-fact tone. Arjun nodded.</p>\n<p>“I am shocked beyond words,” he said. Even the man’s sarcasm was gentle. “The mask is heavy today?”</p>\n<p>The mask, he called it. As if the person she was when she faced the world was the false one, and the one who spoke to him or played painting games with her granddaughters was authentic. She thought he was wrong, but the fiction was so comforting she had always played along.</p>\n<p>“Today, very heavy. What are you doing now, love?”</p>\n<p>“Reading Kukurri’s thesis draft. It needs work.”</p>\n<p>“Are you in your office?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“You should go to the garden,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Because that’s where you want to be? We can go together when you’re home.”</p>\n<p>She sighed.</p>\n<p>“I may be very late,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Wake me, and we can go then.”</p>\n<p>She touched the screen, and he grinned as if he’d felt the caress. She cut the connection. By long habit, they didn’t tell each other goodbye. It was one of a thousand small personal idioms that grew from decades of marriage.</p>\n<p>Avasarala turned to her desk system, pulling up the tactical analysis of the battle on Ganymede, the intelligence profiles of the major military figures within Mars, and the master schedule for the meeting, already half filled in by the generals in the time since her conference. She took a pistachio from her purse, cracked its shell, and let the raw information wash over her, her mind dancing through it. In the window behind her, other stars struggled through the light pollution of the Hague, but Venus was still the brightest.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Six: Holden</h2>\n<p>Holden was dreaming of long twisting corridors filled with half-human horrors when a loud buzzing woke him to a pitch-black cabin. He struggled for a moment with the unfamiliar straps on the bunk before he unbuckled and floated free in the microgravity. The wall panel buzzed again. Holden pushed off the bed to it and hit the button to bring the cabin lights up. The cabin was tiny. A seventy-year-old crash couch above a personal storage locker crammed up against one bulkhead, a toilet and sink built into a corner, and across from the bunk, a wall panel with the name <em>Somnambulist</em> etched above it.</p>\n<p>The panel buzzed a third time. This time Holden hit the reply button and said, “Where are we, Naomi?”</p>\n<p>“Final braking for high orbit. You’re not going to believe this, but they’re making us queue up.”</p>\n<p>“Queue up, as in get in line?”</p>\n<p>“Yep,” Naomi said. “I think they’re boarding all the ships that are landing on Ganymede.”</p>\n<p><em>Shit</em>.</p>\n<p>“Shit. Which side is it?”</p>\n<p>“Does it matter?”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Holden said. “Earth wants me for stealing a couple thousand of their nuclear missiles and handing them over to the OPA. Mars just wants me for stealing one of their ships. I assume those carry different penalties.”</p>\n<p>Naomi laughed. “They’d lock you up for eternity either way.”</p>\n<p>“Call me pedantic, then.”</p>\n<p>“The group we’re in line for look like UN ships, but a Martian frigate is parked right next to them, watching the proceedings.”</p>\n<p>Holden gave a private prayer of thanks for letting Fred Johnson back on Tycho talk him into taking the recently repaired <em>Somnambulist</em> to Ganymede rather than try to land in the <em>Rocinante</em>. The freighter was the least suspicious ship in the OPA fleet right now. Far less likely to draw unwanted attention than their stolen Martian warship. They’d left the <em>Roci</em> parked a million kilometers away from Jupiter in a spot no one was likely to look. Alex had the ship shut down except for air recycling and passive sensors and was probably huddled in his cabin with a space heater and a lot of blankets, waiting for their call.</p>\n<p>“Okay, I’m on my way up. Send a tightbeam to Alex and let him know the situation. If we get arrested, he’s to take the <em>Roci</em> back to Tycho.”</p>\n<p>Holden opened the locker under the bunk and pulled out a badly fitting green jumpsuit with <em>Somnambulist</em> stenciled on the back and the name Philips on the front pocket. According to the ship’s records, provided by the tech wizards back at Tycho, he was crewman first class Walter Philips, engineer and general tool pusher on the food freighter <em>Somnambulist</em>. He was also third-in-command out of a crew of three. Given his reputation in the solar system, it was thought best that Holden not have a job on the ship that would require him to speak to anyone in authority.</p>\n<p>He washed up in his tiny sink—no actual free-flowing water, but a system of moist towels and soaped pads—scratching unhappily at the scraggly beard he’d been growing as part of his disguise. He’d never tried to grow one before, and was disappointed to discover that his facial hair grew in patches of varying length and curl. Amos had grown a beard as well in an act of solidarity and now had a lush lion’s mane, which he was considering keeping because it looked so good.</p>\n<p>Holden slid the used towel into its cycling chamber and pushed off toward the compartment hatch and up the crew ladder to the operations deck.</p>\n<p>Not that it was much of an ops deck. The <em>Somnambulist</em> was nearly a hundred years old and definitely at the end of her life cycle. If they hadn’t needed a throwaway ship for this mission, Fred’s people would probably have just scrapped the old girl out. Her recent run-in with pirates had left her half dead to begin with. But she’d spent the last twenty years of her life flying the Ganymede-to-Ceres food run, and she’d show up in the registry as a regular visitor to the Jovian moon, a ship that might plausibly arrive with relief supplies. Fred thought that with her regular arrivals at Ganymede, she might just get waved past any customs or blockades without a look.</p>\n<p>That, it seemed, had been optimistic.</p>\n<p>Naomi was belted into one of the operations stations when Holden arrived. She wore a green jumpsuit similar to his, though the name on her pocket read <em>Estancia</em>. She gave him a smile, then waved him over to look at her screen.</p>\n<p>“That’s the group of ships that are checking everyone out before they land.”</p>\n<p>“Damn,” Holden said, zooming the telescopic image in to get a better look at the hulls and identifying marks. “Definitely UN ships.” Something small moved across the image from one of the UN ships to the heavy freighter that was currently at the front of the line. “And that looks like a boarding skiff.”</p>\n<p>“Well, good thing you haven’t groomed in a month,” Naomi said, tugging at a lock of his hair. “With that bush on your head and that awful beard, your own mothers wouldn’t recognize you.”</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping they haven’t recruited my mothers,” Holden said, trying to match her lightness of tone. “I’ll warn Amos that they’re coming.”</p>\n<p>Holden, Naomi, and Amos waited in the short locker-filled hallway just outside the inner airlock door for the boarding party to finish cycling the ’lock. Naomi looked tall and stern in her freshly washed captain’s uniform and magnetic boots. Captain Estancia had skippered the <em>Somnambulist</em> for ten years before the pirate attack that took her life. Holden thought Naomi made a suitably regal replacement.</p>\n<p>Behind her, Amos wore a jumpsuit with a chief engineer’s patch and a bored scowl. Even in the microgravity of their current orbit around Ganymede, he seemed to be slouching. Holden did his best to emulate his stance and his half-angry expression.</p>\n<p>The airlock finished cycling, and the inner doors slid open. Six marines in combat armor and a junior lieutenant in an environment suit clanked out on mag boots. The lieutenant quickly looked over the crew and checked them against something on his hand terminal. He looked as bored as Amos did. Holden guessed that this poor junior officer had been stuck with the shit duty of boarding ships all day and was probably in as big a hurry to be done as they were to leave.</p>\n<p>“Rowena Estancia, captain and majority owner of the Ceres-registered freighter <em>Weeping Somnambulist</em>.”</p>\n<p>He didn’t make it a question, but Naomi replied, “Yes, sir.”</p>\n<p>“I like the name,” the lieutenant said without looking up from his terminal.</p>\n<p>“Sir?”</p>\n<p>“The ship name. It’s unusual. I swear, if I board one more ship named after someone’s kid or the girl they left behind after that magical weekend on Titan, I’m going to start fining people for general lack of creativity.”</p>\n<p>Holden felt a tension begin at the base of his spine and creep up toward his scalp. This lieutenant might be bored with his job, but he was smart and perceptive, and he was letting them know it up front.</p>\n<p>“Well, this one is named after the tearful three months I spent on Titan after he left me,” Naomi said with a grin. “Probably a good thing in the long term. I was going to name her after my goldfish.”</p>\n<p>The lieutenant’s head snapped up in surprise; then he began laughing. “Thanks, Captain. That’s the first laugh today. Everyone else is scared shitless of us, and these six slabs of meat”—he gestured at the marines behind him—“have had their senses of humor chemically removed.”</p>\n<p>Holden shot a look to Amos. <em>Is he flirting with her? I think he’s flirting with her</em>. Amos’ scowl could have meant anything.</p>\n<p>The lieutenant tapped something on his terminal and said, “Protein, supplements, water purifiers, and antibiotics. Can I take a quick look?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Naomi said, gesturing toward the hatch. “Right this way.”</p>\n<p>She left, the UN officer and two of the marines in tow. The other four settled into alert-guard poses next to the airlock. Amos elbowed Holden to get his attention, then said, “How you boys doing today?”</p>\n<p>The marines ignored him.</p>\n<p>“I was saying to my buddy here, I was saying, ‘I bet those fancy tin suits those boys wear bind up something awful in the crotch.’ ”</p>\n<p>Holden closed his eyes and started sending psychic messages to Amos to shut up. It didn’t work.</p>\n<p>“I mean, all that fancy high-tech gear strapped on everywhere, and the one thing they don’t allow for is scratching your balls. Or, God forbid, you get outta alignment and gotta give the works a shift to create some space.”</p>\n<p>Holden opened his eyes. The marines were all looking at Amos now, but they hadn’t moved or spoken. Holden shifted to the back corner of the room and tried to press himself into it. No one even glanced in his direction.</p>\n<p>“So,” Amos continued, his voice full of companionable good cheer. “I got this theory, and I was hoping you boys could help me out.”</p>\n<p>The closest marine took a half step forward, but that was all.</p>\n<p>“My theory is,” Amos said, “that to avoid that whole problem, they just go ahead and cut off all those parts that might get caught up in your suit. And it has the added benefit of reducing your temptation to diddle each other during those long cold nights on the ship.”</p>\n<p>The marine took another step, and Amos immediately took one of his own to close the distance. With his nose so close to the marine’s armored faceplate that his breath fogged the glass, Amos said, “So be straight with me, Joe. The outside of those suits, that’s anatomically correct, ain’t it?”</p>\n<p>There was a long, tense silence that was finally broken when someone cleared his throat at the hatch, and the lieutenant came into the corridor. “There a problem here?”</p>\n<p>Amos smiled and stepped back.</p>\n<p>“Nope. Just getting to know the fine men and women my tax dollars help pay for.”</p>\n<p>“Sergeant?” the lieutenant said.</p>\n<p>The marine stepped back.</p>\n<p>“No, sir. No problem.”</p>\n<p>The lieutenant turned around and shook Naomi’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Captain Estancia, it has been a pleasure. Our people will be radioing you with landing clearance shortly. I’m sure the people of Ganymede will be grateful for the supplies you’re bringing.”</p>\n<p>“Happy to help,” Naomi said, and gave the young officer a brilliant smile.</p>\n<p>When the UN troops had cycled back through the airlock and flown away in their skiff, Naomi let out a long breath and began massaging her cheeks.</p>\n<p>“If I had to smile one second longer, my face was going to crack apart.”</p>\n<p>Holden grabbed Amos by the sleeve.</p>\n<p>“What. The. Fuck,” he said through gritted teeth, “was <em>that</em> all about?”</p>\n<p>“What?” Naomi said.</p>\n<p>“Amos here did just about everything he could to piss the marines off while you were gone. I’m surprised they didn’t shoot him, and then me half a second later.”</p>\n<p>Amos glanced down at Holden’s hand, still gripping his arm, but made no move to pull free.</p>\n<p>“Cap, you’re a good guy, but you’d be a shitty smuggler.”</p>\n<p>“What?” Naomi said again.</p>\n<p>“The captain here was so nervous even I started to think he was up to something. So I kept the marines’ attention until you got back,” Amos said. “Oh, and they can’t shoot you unless you actually touch them or draw a weapon. You were a UN Navy boy. You should remember the rules.”</p>\n<p>“So…” Holden started.</p>\n<p>“So,” Amos interrupted. “If the lieutenant asks them about us, they’ll have a story to tell about the asshole engineer who got in their faces, and not the nervous guy with the patchy beard who kept trying to hide in the corner.”</p>\n<p>“Shit,” Holden said.</p>\n<p>“You’re a good captain, and you can have my back in a fight anytime. But you’re a crap criminal. You just don’t know how to act like anyone but yourself.”</p>\n<p>“Wanna be captain again?” Naomi said. “That job sucks.”</p>\n<p>“Ganymede tower, this is <em>Somnambulist</em> repeating our request for a pad assignment,” Naomi said. “We’ve been cleared by the UN patrols, and you’ve had us holding in low orbit for three hours now.”</p>\n<p>Naomi flicked off her mic and added, “Asshole.”</p>\n<p>The voice that replied was different from the one they’d been requesting landing clearance from for the last few hours. This one was older and less annoyed.</p>\n<p>“Sorry, <em>Somnambulist</em> , we’ll get you into the pattern as soon as possible. But we’ve had launches nonstop for the last ten hours, and we still have a dozen ships to get off of the ground before we start letting people land.”</p>\n<p>Holden turned on his mic and said, “We talking to the supervisor now?”</p>\n<p>“Yep. Senior supervisor Sam Snelling if you’re making notes for a complaint. That’s Snelling with two <em>L</em> s.”</p>\n<p>“No, no,” Holden replied. “Not a complaint. We’ve been watching the outgoing ships flying by. Are these refugee ships? With the tonnage we’ve seen lifting off, it looks like half the moon is leaving.”</p>\n<p>“Nope. We do have a few charters and commercial liners taking people off, but most of the ships leaving right now are food freighters.”</p>\n<p>“Food freighters?”</p>\n<p>“We ship almost a hundred thousand kilos of food a <em>day</em> , and the fighting trapped a lot of those shipments on the surface. Now that the blockade is letting people through, they’re on their way out to make their deliveries.”</p>\n<p>“Wait,” Holden said. “I’m waiting to land with relief food supplies for people starving on Ganymede, and you’re launching a hundred thousand kilos of food <em>off</em> the moon?”</p>\n<p>“Closer to half a million, what with the backup,” Sam said. “But we don’t own this food. Most of the food production on Ganymede is owned by corporations that aren’t headquartered here. Lot of money tied up in these shipments. Every day it sat on the ground here, people were losing a fortune.”</p>\n<p>“I…” Holden started, then after a pause said, “ <em>Somnambulist</em> out.”</p>\n<p>Holden turned his chair around to face Naomi. Her expression was closed in a way that meant she was as angry as he was.</p>\n<p><em>Continues...</em><br />\nExcerpted from Caliban's War by Corey, James S.A. Copyright © 2012 by Corey, James S.A..

Vonnegut's fourth novel, it was first published on March 18, 1963,[1] exploring and satirizing issues of science, technology, the purpose of religion, and the arms race, often through the use of morbid humor.<br><br>Cat's Cradle is Kurt Vonnegut's satirical commentary on modern man and his madness. An apocalyptic tale of this planet's ultimate fate, it features a midget as the protagonist, a complete, original theology created by a calypso singer, and a vision of the future that is at once blackly fatalistic and hilariously funny. A book that left an indelible mark on an entire generation of readers, Cat's Cradle is one of the twentieth century's most important works--and Vonnegut at his very best. </p></div>",

They belong to the Overlords, an alien race far superior to humanity in technological development. Their purpose is to dominate Earth.

Tchaikovsky's good sense of pacing and his ability to make arcane scenes and concepts vividly transparent all contribute to a winning tale ...

    "description": "<div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold\"><em>Cloud Atlas</em> by David Mitchell is a challenging and adventurous journey that will captivate readers who appreciate complex, interconnected storytelling, philosophical explorations of humanity's relationship with power, and the intersection of science fiction and historical fiction, making it a perfect fit for readers who crave intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant literature.</p>\n<p>______<br><br>A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity. <br><br><em>Cloud Atlas</em> begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .<br><br>Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . <br><br>From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . <br><br>And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.<br><br><br>But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.<br><br>As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, <em>Cloud Atlas</em> is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic\">Cloud Cuckoo Land by Anthony Doerr is a perfect fit for readers who crave stories that weave together hope, human connection, and the transformative power of stories across time, transporting them to a world of wonder, resilience, and redemption. (StoryGraph)</span><br><br>_______<br><br>From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of perhaps the most bestselling and beloved literary fiction of our time comes a triumph of imagination and compassion, a soaring novel about children on the cusp of adulthood in a broken world, who find resilience, hope, and story. <br><br>The heroes of Cloud Cuckoo Land are children trying to figure out the world around them, and to survive. In the besieged city of Constantinople in 1453, in a public library in Lakeport, Idaho, today, and on a spaceship bound for a distant exoplanet decades from now, an ancient text provides solace and the most profound human connection to characters in peril. <br><br>They all learn the story of Aethon, who longs to be turned into a bird so that he can fly to the paradise of Cloud Cuckoo Land, a better world. Twelve-year-old Anna lives in a convent where women toil all day embroidering the robes of priests. She learns to read from an old Greek tutor she encounters on her errands in the city. In an abandoned priory, she finds a stash of old books. One is Aethon's story, which she reads to her sister as the walls of Constantinople are bombarded by armies of Saracens. Anna escapes, carrying only a small sack with bread, salt fish--and the book. Outside the city walls, Anna meets Omeir, a village boy who was conscripted, along with his beloved pair of oxen, to fight in the Sultan's conquest. His oxen have died; he has deserted. <br><br>In Lakeport, Idaho, in 2020, Seymour, a young activist bent on saving the earth, sits in the public library with two homemade bombs in pressure cookers--another siege. Upstairs, eighty-five-year old Zeno, a former prisoner-of-war, and an amateur translator, rehearses five children in a play adaptation of Aethon's adventures. <br><br>On an interstellar ark called The Argos, Konstance is alone in a vault with sacks of Nourish powder and access to all the information in the world--or so she is told. She knows Aethon's story through her father, who has sequestered her to protect her. Konstance, encased on a spaceship decades from now, has never lived on our beloved Earth. Alone in a vault with sacks of Nourish powder and access to \"all the information in the world,\" she knows Aethon's storythrough her father. <br><br>Like Marie-Laure and Werner in All the Light We Cannot See, Konstance, Anna, Omeir, Seymour, the young Zeno, the children in the library are dreamers and misfits on the cusp of adulthood in a world the grown-ups have broken. They through their own resilience and resourcefulness, and through story. <br><br>Dedicated to \"the librarians then, now, and in the years to come,\" Anthony Doerr's Cloud Cuckoo Land is about the power of story and the astonishing survival of the physical book when for thousands of years they were so rare and so feared, dying, as one character says, \"in fires or floods or in the mouths of worms or at the whims of tyrants. <br><br>_______<br><br>\"It is a hauntingly beautiful and redemptive novel about stewardship--of the book, of the Earth, of the human heart\"</p></div>",

(StoryGraph)<br></p>\n<p>Short, absurdist-lite, quirky, super clean writing. About belonging and not fitting in. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic\"><br></span>____<br><br>Keiko Furukura had always been considered a strange child, and her parents always worried how she would get on in the real world, so when she takes on a job in a convenience store while at university, they are delighted for her. For her part, in the convenience store she finds a predictable world mandated by the store manual, which dictates how the workers should act and what they should say, and she copies her coworkers' style of dress and speech patterns so she can play the part of a normal person. However, eighteen years later, at age 36, she is still in the same job, has never had a boyfriend, and has only few friends. She feels comfortable in her life but is aware that she is not living up to society's expectations and causing her family to worry about her. When a similarly alienated but cynical and bitter young man comes to work in the store, he will upset Keiko's contented stasis—but will it be for the better?<br><br>Sayaka Murata brilliantly captures the atmosphere of the familiar convenience store that is so much part of life in Japan. With some laugh-out-loud moments prompted by the disconnect between Keiko's thoughts and those of the people around her, she provides a sharp look at Japanese society and the pressure to conform, as well as penetrating insights into the female mind. <em>Convenience Store Woman</em> is a fresh, charming portrait of an unforgettable heroine that recalls Banana Yoshimoto, Han Kang, and <em>Amelie</em>.</p></div>",

Wodehouse in Crosstalk—a genre-bending novel that pushes social media, smartphone technology, and twenty-four-hour availability to hilarious and chilling extremes as one young woman abruptly finds herself with way more connectivity than she ever desired.</p>\n\n<p>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR In the not-too-distant future, a simple outpatient procedure to increase empathy between romantic partners has become all the rage. And Briddey Flannigan is delighted when her boyfriend, Trent, suggests undergoing the operation prior to a marriage proposal—to enjoy better emotional connection and a perfect relationship with complete communication and understanding. But things don’t quite work out as planned, and Briddey finds herself connected to someone else entirely—in a way far beyond what she signed up for. It is almost more than she can handle—especially when the stress of managing her all-too-eager-to-communicate-at-all-times family is already burdening her brain. But that’s only the beginning. As things go from bad to worse, she begins to see the dark side of too much information, and to realize that love—and communication—are far more complicated than she ever imagined.</p>\n\n<p>Praise for Crosstalk“A rollicking send-up of obsessive cell phone usage in too-near-future America . . . [Connie] Willis’s canny incorporation of scientific lore, and a riotous cast . . . make for an engaging girl-finally-finds-right-boy story that’s unveiled with tact and humor. Willis juxtaposes glimpses of claimed historical telepaths with important reflections about the ubiquity of cell phones and the menace that unscrupulous developers of technology pose to privacy, morality, and emotional stability.”—Publishers Weekly “An exhilarating and laugh-inducing read . . . one of those rare books that will keep you up all night long because you can’t bear to put it down.”—Portland Book Review “A fun technological fairy tale.”—BookPage “One of the funniest SF novels in years.”—Locus</p>",

Relayed in his own unsparing voice, Demon braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.</p>\n<p>Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield from his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. Dickens is not a prerequisite for readers of this novel, but he provided its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens’ anger and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of a good story. Demon Copperhead speaks for a new generation of lost boys, and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can’t imagine leaving behind.</p></div>",

Based on the historical details of Charles Dickens's life and narrated by Wilkie Collins (Dickens's friend, frequent collaborator, and Salieri-style secret rival), Drood explores the still-unsolved mysteries of the famous author's last years and may provide the key to Dickens's final, unfinished work: The Mystery of Edwin Drood. <br><br>Chilling, haunting, and utterly original, Drood is Dan Simmons at his powerful best.</p></div>",

Now, for the first time, this entire masterpiece of the imagination is available in one extraordinary eBook bundle:   HYPERION THE FALL OF HYPERION ENDYMION THE RISE OF ENDYMION   On the planet Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. On the eve of Armageddon, with the known universe at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of existence. As the Shrike anticipates their mission, each traveler nurtures a desperate hope—and harbors a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his or her hands.   Praise for The Hyperion Cantos   “For vastness of scope, clarity of detail and seriousness of purpose, Simmons’s epic narrative is on a par with Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, Frank Herbert’s Dune books, Gene Wolfe’s multipart Book of the New Sun and Brian Aldiss’s Helliconia trilogy.”—The New York Times Book Review   “Dan Simmons has brilliantly conceptualized a future 700 years distant. In sheer scope and complexity it matches, and perhaps even surpasses, those of Isaac Asimov and James Blish.”—The Washington Post Book World   “State of the art science fiction . . . This work will be that against which all future works will have to be measured, in the same way, in their time, that Asimov’s Foundation series and Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness set new standards.”—Asimov’s   “Simmons’ own genius transforms space opera into a new kind of poetry.”—The Denver Post   “A major work . . .

On the world called Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope—and a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands. Praise for Dan Simmons and Hyperion “Dan Simmons has brilliantly conceptualized a future 700 years distant. In sheer scope and complexity it matches, and perhaps even surpasses, those of Isaac Asimov and James Blish.”—The Washington Post Book World  “An unfailingly inventive narrative . . . generously conceived and stylistically sure-handed.”—The New York Times Book Review “Simmons’s own genius transforms space opera into a new kind of poetry.”—The Denver Post “An essential part of any science fiction collection.”—Booklist</p>",

Shy and new in town, he is a stranger to the social rituals practiced by his classmates and soon becomes isolated, with his neighbor—a married woman close to his mother’s age, whom he begrudgingly helps with errands—as his only companion. But as these periodical encounters shift into a clandestine relationship that István himself can barely understand, his life soon spirals out of control, ending in a violent accident that leaves a man dead.<br><br>What follows is a rocky trajectory that sees István emigrate from Hungary to London, where he moves from job to job before finding steady work as a driver for London’s billionaire class. At each juncture, his life is affected by the goodwill or self-interest of strangers. Through it all, István is a calm, detached observer of his own life, and through his eyes we experience a tragic twist on an immigrant “success story,” brightened by moments of sensitivity, softness, and Szalay’s keen observation.<br><br>Fast-paced and immersive, <em>Flesh</em> reveals István’s life through intimate moments, with lovers, employers, and family members, charted over the course of decades.

    "description": "<div>\n<p>Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling. If humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second empire arises. However, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only 1,000 if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled the Encyclopedia Galactica. The board is still wary, but allows Seldon to assemble whomever he needs, provided he and the \"Encyclopedists\" are exiled to a remote planet, Terminus. Seldon agrees to these terms – and secretly establishes a second foundation of which almost nothing is known, which he says is at the \"opposite end\" of the galaxy. After 50 years on Terminus, and with Seldon dead, the inhabitants find themselves in a crisis. With four powerful planets surrounding theirs, the Encyclopedists have no defenses but their own intelligence. A vault left by Seldon is due to automatically open and it reveals a recorded hologram of Seldon, who informs the Encyclopedists that their reason for being on Terminus is bogus, Seldon did not care whether or not an encyclopedia was created, only that the population was placed on Terminus and the events needed by his calculations were set in motion. In reality, the recording discloses, Terminus was set up to reduce the Dark Ages based on his calculations. It will develop by facing intermittent and extreme \"crises\" – known as \"Seldon Crises\" – which the laws governing psychohistory show will inevitably be overcome, simply because human nature will cause events to fall in particular ways which lead to the intended goal. The recording reveals that the present events are the first such crisis, reminds them that a second foundation was also formed at the \"opposite end\" of the galaxy, and then falls silent. The Mayor of Terminus City, Salvor Hardin, proposes to play the planets against each other. His plan is a success; the Foundation remains untouched, and he becomes its ruler. The minds of the Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are more compact and powerful than the Empire's equivalents. Using its scientific advantages, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a coveted commodity. The interplanetary traders become diplomats to other planets. One such trader, Hober Mallow, becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the office of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation's control.</p></div>",

Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch – ‘Scout’ – returns home from New York City to visit her ageing father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise’s homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from <em>To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman</em> perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past – a journey that can be guided only by one’s own conscience. <br><br>Written in the mid-1950s, <em>Go Set a Watchman</em> imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humour and effortless precision – a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> , but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context and new meaning to a classic.</p></div>",

    "description": "<p>GONE WITH THE WIND is a novel by American writer Margaret Mitchell, first published in 1936. The story is set in Clayton County and Atlanta, both in Georgia, during the American Civil War and Reconstruction Era. It depicts the struggles of young Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner, who must use every means at her disposal to claw her way out of poverty following Sherman's destructive \"March to the Sea.</p>\n\n<p>\" This historical novel features a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, with the title taken from a poem written by Ernest Dowson. Gone with the Wind was popular with American readers from the outset and was the top American fiction bestseller in 1936 and 1937. As of 2014, a Harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of American readers, just behind the Bible. More than 30 million copies have been printed worldwide. Mitchell received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the book in 1937. It was adapted into a 1939 American film. Gone with the Wind is the only novel by Mitchell published during her lifetime.</p>",

At fifteen, she drops out of school and finds an unexpected and dangerous patron in a wealthy bootlegger who provides a plane and subsidizes her lessons, an arrangement that will haunt her for the rest of her life, even as it allows her to fulfill her destiny: circumnavigating the globe by flying over the North and South poles.<br><br>A century later, Hadley Baxter is cast to play Marian in a film that centers on Marian's disappearance in Antarctica.

Her immersion into the character of Marian unfolds, thrillingly, alongside Marian's own story, as the two women's fates--and their hunger for self-determination in vastly different geographies and times--collide.

It was first published in monthly installments as a serial in 1915 in The Forerunner, a magazine edited and written by Gilman between 1909 and 1916, with its sequel, With Her in Ourland beginning immediately thereafter in the January 1916 issue. The book is often considered to be the middle volume in her utopian trilogy; preceded by Moving the Mountain (1911), and followed by, With Her in Ourland (1916). It was not published in book form until 1979.</p></div>",

No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth—musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies—the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children. <br><br>Now made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and second and third appendices, the story remains unchanged. Similarly, the cultural fascination with House of Leaves remains as fervent and as imaginative as ever. The novel has gone on to inspire doctorate-level courses and masters theses, cultural phenomena like the online urban legend of “the backrooms,” and incredible works of art in entirely unrealted mediums from music to video games. Neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of the impossibility of their new home, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.</p></div>",

On the world called Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope—and a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands. Praise for Dan Simmons and Hyperion “Dan Simmons has brilliantly conceptualized a future 700 years distant. In sheer scope and complexity it matches, and perhaps even surpasses, those of Isaac Asimov and James Blish.”—The Washington Post Book World  “An unfailingly inventive narrative . . . generously conceived and stylistically sure-handed.”—The New York Times Book Review “Simmons’s own genius transforms space opera into a new kind of poetry.”—The Denver Post “An essential part of any science fiction collection.”—Booklist</p>",

(Storygraph)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam &amp; Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life.<br><br>Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.<br><br>In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships.<br><br>These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam &amp; Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants. Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.</p></div>",

    "description": "<p>This classic science fiction masterwork by Isaac Asimov weaves stories about robots, humanity, and the deep questions of existence into a novel of shocking intelligence and heart. “A must-read for science-fiction buffs and literature enjoyers alike.”—The Guardian I, Robot, the first and most widely read book in Asimov’s Robot series, forever changed the world’s perception of artificial intelligence. Here are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-reading robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world—all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asimov’s trademark.  The Three Laws of Robotics: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. With these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov formulated the laws governing robots’ behavior. In I, Robot, Asimov chronicles the development of the robot from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future—a  future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete. “Tremendously exciting and entertaining . . . Asimov dramatizes an interesting question: How can we live with machines that, generation by generation, grow more intelligent than their creators and not eventually clash with our own invention?”—The Chicago Tribune</p>",

Published in 2004, it is an alternative history set in 19th-century England around the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Its premise is that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange.</p>\n<p> _____</p>\n<p>English magicians were once the wonder of the known world, with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds, mountains, and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.</p>\n<p>But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French. </p>\n<p>All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative-the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. </p>\n<p>For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.</p></div>",

It's 1984, and Britain (now called Airstrip One) has long been absorbed into the larger trans-Atlantic nation of Oceania.

She's an ideal citizen of Oceania. Cheerfully cynical, believing in nothing and caring not at all about politics, she routinely breaks the rules but also collaborates with the regime whenever necessary. Everyone likes Julia. But when one day, finding herself walking toward Winston in a corridor, she impulsively hands him a note--a potentially suicidal gesture--she comes to realize that she's losing her grip and can no longer safely navigate her world.<br><br>The passing of that note sets into motion the devastating, unforgettable events of the classic story. Julia takes us on a surprising journey as seen through the eyes of an indestructible young woman trying to survive in Orwell's now-iconic dystopian world, while laying bare our own world in bold and proactive ways, just as the original did almost seventy-five years ago. </p></div>",

Butler is a gripping and unflinching journey through the brutal realities of slavery and the ongoing impact of racism, perfect for those seeking a powerful and emotionally charged reading experience. (Storygraph)</em><br><br>“I lost an arm on my last trip home. My left arm.” <br><br>Dana’s torment begins when she suddenly vanishes on her 26th birthday from California, 1976, and is dragged through time to antebellum Maryland to rescue a boy named Rufus, heir to a slaveowner’s plantation. She soon realizes the purpose of her summons to the past: protect Rufus to ensure his assault of her Black ancestor so that she may one day be born. As she endures the traumas of slavery and the soul-crushing normalization of savagery, Dana fights to keep her autonomy and return to the present. <br><br>Blazing the trail for neo-slavery narratives like Colson Whitehead’s <em>The Underground Railroad</em> and Ta-Nehisi Coates’s <em>The Water Dancer</em> , Butler takes one of speculative fiction’s oldest tropes and infuses it with lasting depth and power. Dana not only experiences the cruelties of slavery on her skin but also grimly learns to accept it as a condition of her own existence in the present. <br><br>______<br><br>“Where stories about American slavery are often gratuitous, reducing its horror to explicit violence and brutality, <em>Kindred</em> is controlled and precise” (<em>New York Times</em>). <br><br>“Reading Octavia Butler taught me to dream big, and I think it’s absolutely necessary that everybody have that freedom and that willingness to dream.” <br>—N. K. Jemisin <br><br><strong>Developed for television by writer/executive producer Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (</strong> Watchmen <strong>), executive producers also include Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields (</strong> The Americans <strong>,</strong> The Patient <strong>), and Darren Aronofsky (</strong> The Whale <strong>). Janicza Bravo (</strong> Zola <strong>) is director and an executive producer of the pilot.</strong> Kindred <strong>stars Mallori Johnson, Micah Stock, Ryan Kwanten, and Gayle Rankin.<br><br></strong>**Selected by The Atlantic as one of THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVELS.

Neveah and their father, who run the Carruthers Crematorium in the run-down central Virginia town of Jefferson Run, see death up close every day. But mortality draws even closer when it becomes clear that the crash that landed their father in a coma was no accident and Dante’s recklessness has placed them all in real danger.</p>\n<p>Roman, a financial whiz with a head for numbers and a talent for making his clients rich, has some money to help buy his brother out of trouble. But in his work with wannabe tough guys, he’s forgotten that there are real gangsters out there.

The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln's beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. \"My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,\" the president says at the time. \"God has called him home.\" Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy's body. <br><br>From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state--called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo--a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul.<br><br>Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction's ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end? <br><br>_____<br><br>In his long-awaited first novel, American master George Saunders delivers his most original, transcendent, and moving work yet. Unfolding in a graveyard over the course of a single night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices, <em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em> is a literary experience unlike any other—for no one but Saunders could conceive it.</p></div>",

His name was Smoky Barnable, and he was going to Edgewood to get married; the fact that he walked and didn't ride was one of the conditions placed on his coming there at all.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold\">Somewhere to Elsewhere</p>\n<p>Though he had left his City room early in the morning it was nearly noon before he had crossed the huge bridge on a little-used walkway and come out into the named but boundaryless towns on the north side of the river. Through the afternoon he negotiated those Indian-named places, usually unable to take the straight route commanded by the imperious and constant flow of traffic; he wentneighborhood by neighborhood, looking down alleys and into stores. He saw few walkers, even indigenous, though there were kids on bikes; he wondered about their lives in these places, which to him seemed gloomily peripheral, though the kids were cheerful enough.</p>\n<p>The regular blocks of commercial avenues and residential streets began gradually to become disordered, thinning like the extremesof a great forest; began to be broken by weedy lots as though by glades; now and then a dusty undergrown woods or a scruffy meadow announced that it was available to be turned into an industrial park. Smoky turned that phrase over in his mind, since that seemed truly the place in the world where he was, the industrial park, between the desert and the sown.</p>\n<p>He stopped at a bench where people could catch buses from Somewhere to Elsewhere. He sat, shrugged his small pack from his back, took from it a sandwich he had made himself—another condition—and a confetti-colored gas-station road map. He wasn't sure if the map were forbidden by the conditions, but the directions he'd been given to get to Edgewood weren't explicit, and he opened it.</p>\n<p>Now. This blue line was apparently the cracked macadam lined with untenanted brick factories he had been walking along. He turned the map so that this line ran parallel to his bench, as the road did (he wasn't much of a map reader) and found, far off to his left, the place he walked toward. The name Edgewood didn't appear, actually, but it was <em>here</em> somewhere, in this group of five towns marked with the legend's most insignificant bullets. So. There was a mighty double red line that went near there, proud with exits and entrances; he couldn't walk along that. A thick blue line (on the model of the vascular system, Smoky imagined all the traffic flowing south to the city on the blue lines, away on the red) ran somewhat nearer, extending corpuscular access to towns and townlets along the way. The much thinner sclerotic blue line he sat beside was tributary to this; probably commerce had moved there, Tool Town, Food City, Furniture World, Carpet Village. Well... But there was also, almost indistinguishable, a narrow black line he could take soon instead. He thought at first that it led nowhere, but no, it went on, faltering, seeming at first almost forgotten by the mapmaker in the ganglia, but then growing clearer in the northward emptiness, and coming very near a town Smoky knew to be near Edgewood.</p>\n<p>That one, then. It seemed a walker's road.</p>\n<p>After measuring with his thumb and finger the distance on the map he had come, and how far he had to go (much farther), he slung on his pack, tilted his hat against the sun, and went on.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold\">A Long Drink of Water</p>\n<p>She was not much in his mind as he walked, though for sure she hadn't been far from it often in the last nearly two years he had loved her; the room he had met her in was one he looked into with the mind's eye often, sometimes with the trepidation he had felt then, but often nowadays with a grateful happiness; looked in to see George Mouse showing him from afar a glass, a pipe, and his two tall cousins: she, and her shy sister behind her.</p>\n<p>It was in the Mouse townhouse, last tenanted house on the block, in the library on the third floor, the one whose mullioned windows were patched with cardboard and whose dark rug was worn white in pathways between door, bar and windows. It was that very room.</p>\n<p>She was tall.</p>\n<p>She was nearly six feet tall, which was several inches taller than Smoky; her sister, just turned fourteen, was as tall as he. Their party dresses were short, and glittered, hers red, her sister's white; their long, long stockings glistened. What was odd was that tall as they were they were shy, especially the younger, who smiled but wouldn't take Smoky's hand, only turned away further behind her sister.</p>\n<p>Delicate giantesses. The older glanced toward George as he made debonair introductions. Her smile was tentative. Her hair was red-gold and curly-fine. Her name, George said, was Daily Alice.</p>\n<p>He took her hand, looking up. \"A long drink of water,\" he said, and she began to laugh. Her sister laughed too, and George Mouse bent down and slapped his knee. Smoky, not knowing why the old chestnut should be so funny, looked from one to another with a seraphic idiot's grin, his hand unrelinquished.</p>\n<p>It was the happiest moment of his life.</p>\n<p>It had not been, until he met Daily Alice Drinkwater in the library of the Mouse townhouse, a life particularly charged with happiness; but it happened to be a life suited just right for the courtship he then set out on. He was the only child of his father's second marriage, and was . . .</p>\n<p><em>Continues...</em><br>Excerpted from Little, Bigby John Crowley Copyright ©2006 by John Crowley.

As Susan knows only too well, vintage crime sells handsomely. It's just a shame that it means dealing with an author like Alan Conway... But Conway's latest tale of murder at Pye Hall is not quite what it seems. Yes, there are dead bodies and a host of intriguing suspects, but hidden in the pages of the manuscript there lies another story: a tale written between the very words on the page, telling of real-life jealousy, greed, ruthless ambition and murder.

But after just a few days on the job, Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than the name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything, instead “checking out” impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he’s embarked on a complex analysis of the customers’ behavior and roped his friends into helping to figure out just what’s going on. But once they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, it turns out the secrets extend far outside the walls of the bookstore.<br><br>With irresistible brio and dazzling intelligence, Robin Sloan has crafted a literary adventure story for the twenty-first century, evoking both the fairy-tale charm of Haruki Murakami and the enthusiastic novel-of-ideas wizardry of Neal Stephenson or a young Umberto Eco, but with a unique and feisty sensibility that’s rare to the world of literary fiction. *Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore* is exactly what it sounds like: an establishment you have to enter and will never want to leave, a modern-day cabinet of wonders ready to give a jolt of energy to every curious reader, no matter the time of day.</p></div>",

Burroughs is ideal for readers who relish transgressive, hallucinatory narratives that blend dark humor with unflinching explorations of addiction, identity, and societal decay. (StoryGraph)<br></span><br>______</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The book is structured as a series of loosely connected vignettes. Burroughs stated that the chapters are intended to be read in any order. The reader follows the narration of junkie William Lee, who takes on various aliases, from the U.S. to Mexico, eventually to Tangier and the dreamlike Interzone.<br><br>The vignettes are drawn from Burroughs' own experiences in these places and his addiction to drugs (heroin, morphine, and while in Tangier, majoun [a strong hashish confection] as well as a German opioid, brand name Eukodol, of which he wrote frequently).<br><br>_______</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: large\">Amazon.com Review</p>\n<p>\"He was,\" as <em>Salon</em>'s Gary Kamyia notes, \"20th-century drug culture's Poe, its Artaud, its Baudelaire. He was the prophet of the literature of pure experience, a phenomenologist of dread.... Burroughs had the scary genius to turn the junk wasteland into a parallel universe, one as thoroughly and obsessively rendered as Blake's.\" </p>\n<p>Why has this homosexual ex-junkie, whose claim to fame rests entirely on one book--the hallucinogenic ravings of a heroin addict--so seized the collective imagination? Burroughs wrote <em>Naked Lunch</em> in a Tangier, Morocco, hotel room between 1954 and 1957. Allen Ginsberg and his beatnik cronies burst onto the scene, rescued the manuscript from the food-encrusted floor, and introduced some order to the pages. It was published in Paris in 1959 by the notorious Olympia Press and in the U.S. in 1962; the landmark obscenity trial that ensued served to end literary censorship in America. </p>\n<p>Burroughs's literary experiment--the much-touted \"cut-up\" technique--mirrored the workings of a junkie's brain. But it was junk coupled with vision: Burroughs makes teeming amalgam of allegory, sci-fi, and non-linear narration, all wrapped in a blend of humor--slapstick, Swiftian, slang-infested humor. What is <em>Naked Lunch</em> about? People turn into blobs amidst the sort of evil that R. Crumb, in the decades to come, would inimitably flesh out with his dark and creepy cartoon images. Perhaps the most easily grasped part of <em>Naked Lunch</em> is its America-bashing, replete with slang and vitriol. Read it and see for yourself. </p>\n<h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>\n<p>William S. Burroughs's classic tale has been fully restored by his longtime editors, Grauerholz and Miles, and is invigorated by this enthusiastic reading. Mark Bramhall offers a professional performance peppered with every trick of the actor's trade to make it a resonating effort. He approaches the work with such energy that the story seems like a new entity, freshly relevant and timely. Listeners will lose themselves in the journey of junkie William Lee as he makes his way from bizarre destination to even more bizarre destination in this unforgettable novel. <em>A Grove paperback.

He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake's high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief.  </p>\n<p>With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter.

    "description": "<p>The international runaway bestseller that inspired the most watched show of the summer, from executive producer M. Night Shyamalan, starring Matt Dillon</p>\n<p>Secret service agent Ethan Burke arrives in Wayward Pines, Idaho, with a clear mission: locate and recover two federal agents who went missing in the bucolic town one month earlier. But within minutes of his arrival, Ethan is involved in a violent accident. He comes to in a hospital, with no ID, no cell phone, and no briefcase. The medical staff seems friendly enough, but something feels…off. As the days pass, Ethan’s investigation into the disappearance of his colleagues turns up more questions than answers. Why can’t he get any phone calls through to his wife and son in the outside world? Why doesn’t anyone believe he is who he says he is? And what is the purpose of the electrified fences surrounding the town? Are they meant to keep the residents in? Or something else out? Each step closer to the truth takes Ethan further from the world he thought he knew, from the man he thought he was, until he must face a horrifying fact—he may never get out of Wayward Pines alive. </p>\n<p><em>2013 International Thriller Award Nominee</em></p><h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p>Blake Crouch was born in the North Carolina piedmont in 1978.

When Papissa Joanna was first published in Athens in 1886 it created a sensation. The book was banned and its author excommunicated.

It is their most popular and most widely translated novel outside the former Soviet Union. As of 2003, Boris Strugatsky counted 55 publications of Roadside Picnic in 22 countries.[1] <br><br>The story was published in English in a translation by Antonina W. Bouis. A preface to the first American edition[2] was written by Theodore Sturgeon. Stanisław Lem wrote an afterword to the German edition of 1977. Another English translation by Olena Bormashenko was published in 2012, with a foreword by Ursula K. Le Guin and an afterword by Boris Strugatsky.[3] <br><br>The book has been the source of many adaptations and other inspired works in a variety of media, including stage plays, video games, and television series. The 1979 film Stalker, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, is loosely based on the novel, with a screenplay written by the Strugatsky brothers. <br><br>Later, in 2007, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, the first installment of a video game franchise taking inspiration from both the book and the film, was released as well. <br><br>The term stalker (сталкер) became a part of the Russian language and, according to the authors, became the most popular of their neologisms. In the book, stalkers are people who trespass into the forbidden area known as the Zone and steal its valuable extraterrestrial artifacts, which they later sell. <br><br>In Russian, after Tarkovsky's film, the term acquired the meaning of a guide who navigates forbidden or uncharted territories; later on, urbexers and fans of industrial tourism, especially those visiting abandoned sites and ghost towns, were also called stalkers.[4][5][6]<br><br>______</p>\n<h3>Review</h3>\n<p>\"[a] vivid new translation... it has survived triumphantly as a classic.\"—<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p>\n<p>\"The story is carried out with a controlled fierceness that doesn't waver for a minute.\"  —<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p>\n<p>\"Brilliantly and beautifully written . . . a truly superb work of science fiction.\"  —<em>Infinity Plus</em></p>\n<p>\"Lively, racy, and likable . . . complex in event, imaginative in detail, ethically and intellectually sophisticated.\"  —Ursula K.

    "description": "<div>\n<p>One of the most important books and television series ever to appear, <em>Roots</em>, galvanized the nation, and created an extraordinary political, racial, social and cultural dialogue that hadn’t been seen since the publication of <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>. The book sold over one million copies in the first year, and the miniseries was watched by an astonishing 130 million people. It also won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. <em>Roots</em> opened up the minds of Americans of all colors and faiths to one of the darkest and most painful parts of America’s past.  </p>\n<p>Over the years, both <em>Roots</em> and Alex Haley have attracted controversy, which comes with the territory for trailblazing, iconic books, particularly on the topic of race. Some of the criticism results from whether <em>Roots</em> is fact or fiction and whether Alex Haley confused these two issues, a subject he addresses directly in the book. There is also the fact that Haley was sued for plagiarism when it was discovered that several dozen paragraphs in <em>Roots</em> were taken directly from a novel, The African, by Harold Courlander, who ultimately received a substantial financial settlement at the end of the case.  </p>\n<p>But none of the controversy affects the basic issue. <em>Roots</em> fostered a remarkable dialogue about not just the past, but the then present day 1970s and how America had fared since the days portrayed in <em>Roots</em>. Vanguard Press feels that it is important to publish <em>Roots: The 30th Anniversary Edition</em> to remind the generation that originally read it that there are issues that still need to be discussed and debated, and to introduce to a new and younger generation, a book that will help them understand, perhaps for the first time, the reality of what took place during the time of <em>Roots</em>.<br></p>\n<p>**</p>\n<h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>\n<p><em>Starred Review.</em> It's hard to believe that it has been 30 years since Alex Haley's groundbreaking historical novel (based on his own family's history) was first published and became a worldwide phenomenon. Millions have read the story of the young African boy named Kunte Kinte, who in the late 1700s was kidnapped from his homeland and brought to the United States as a slave. Haley follows Kunte Kinte's family line over the next seven generations, creating a moving historical novel spanning 200 years. Avery Brooks proves to be the perfect choice to bring Haley's devastatingly powerful piece of American literature to audio. Brooks's rich, deep baritone brings a deliberate, dignified, at times almost reverential interpretation to his reading, but never so reserved as to forget that at its heart this is a story about people and family. His multiple characterizations manage, with a smooth and accomplished ease, to capture the true essence of each individual in the book. Michael Eric Dyson offers an informative introduction to Haley's book, but it is Brooks's performance that brings the author's words and history to life. <br>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. </p>\n<h3>Review</h3>\n<p>''The book is an act of love, and it is this which makes it haunting.'' --<em>New York Times</em> </p>\n<p>''A gripping mixture of urban confessional and political manifesto, it not only inspired a generation of black activists, but drove home the bitter realities of racism to a mainstream white liberal audience.'' --<em>Observer</em> </p>\n<p>''Groundbreaking.'' --<em>Associated Press</em> </p>\n<p>''A Pulitzer Prize-winning story about the family ancestry of author Alex Haley... [and] a symbolic chronicle of the odyssey of African Americans from the continent of Africa to a land not of their choosing.'' --<em>Washington Post</em></p></div>",

Scarborough the novel employs a multitude of voices to tell the story of a tight-knit neighborhood under fire: among them, Victor, a black artist harassed by the police; Winsum, a West Indian restaurant owner struggling to keep it together; and Hina, a Muslim school worker who witnesses first-hand the impact of poverty on education.</p>\n\n<p>And then there are the three kids who work to rise above a system that consistently fails them: Bing, a gay Filipino boy who lives under the shadow of his father's mental illness; Sylvie, Bing's best friend, a Native girl whose family struggles to find a permanent home to live in; and Laura, whose history of neglect by her mother is destined to repeat itself with her father.</p>\n\n<p>Scarborough offers a raw yet empathetic glimpse into a troubled community that locates its dignity in unexpected places: a neighborhood that refuses to be undone.</p>\n\n<p>Catherine Hernandez is a queer theatre practitioner and writer who has lived in Scarborough off and on for most of her life.

    "description": "<div>\n<p><em>Frankenstein, The Time Machine, Star Trek, Dune, 1984, Blade Runner</em>--science fiction has been explained as a combination of romance, science, and prophecy; as a genre based on an imagined alternative to the reader's environment; and as a form of fantastic fiction and historical literature. It has also been argued that science fiction narratives are the most engaged, socially relevant, and responsive to the modern technological environment. In this Very Short Introduction, David Seed doesn't offer a history of science fiction, but instead attempts to tie examples of science fiction to different historical moments, in order to demonstrate how science fiction has evolved over time, especially the emergence of science fiction as a popular genre in the 20th century. Seed looks not only at literature, but also at drama and poetry, as well as film. Examining recurrent themes in science fiction, he looks at voyages into space, the concept of the alien and alternative social identities, the role of technology in science fiction, and its relation to time--in the past, present, and future. </p>\n<p><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style,<strong> Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.</p>\n<p>**</p></div>",

Rumors of wrongdoing had long circulated. But in 2017, when Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began their investigation into the prominent Hollywood producer for the New York Times, his name was still synonymous with power. During months of confidential interviews with top actresses, former Weinstein employees, and other sources, many disturbing and long-buried allegations were unearthed, and a web of onerous secret payouts and nondisclosure agreements was revealed. These shadowy settlements had long been used to hide sexual harassment and abuse, but with a breakthrough reporting technique Kantor and Twohey helped to expose it. But Weinstein had evaded scrutiny in the past, and he was not going down without a fight; he employed a team of high-profile lawyers, private investigators, and other allies to thwart the investigation. When Kantor and Twohey were finally able to convince some sources to go on the record, a dramatic final showdown between Weinstein and the New York Times was set in motion.<br><br>Nothing could have prepared Kantor and Twohey for what followed the publication of their initial Weinstein story on October 5, 2017. Within days, a veritable Pandora's box of sexual harassment and abuse was opened. Women all over the world came forward with their own traumatic stories. Over the next twelve months, hundreds of men from every walk of life and industry were outed following allegations of wrongdoing. But did too much change--or not enough? Those questions hung in the air months later as Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford came forward to testify that he had assaulted her decades earlier. Kantor and Twohey, who had unique access to Ford and her team, bring to light the odyssey that led her to come forward, the overwhelming forces that came to bear on her, and what happened after she shared her allegation with the world.<br><br>In the tradition of great investigative journalism, She Said tells a thrilling story about the power of truth, with shocking new information from hidden sources. Kantor and Twohey describe not only the consequences of their reporting for the #MeToo movement, but the inspiring and affecting journeys of the women who spoke up--for the sake of other women, for future generations, and for themselves.</p></div>",

Where society is squeezed into hive-living madness by god-like mega computers, mass-marketed psychedelic drugs, and mundane uses of genetic engineering.

Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo-turned-EMT, is in the audience and leaps to his aid. A child actress named Kirsten Raymonde watches in horror as Jeevan performs CPR, pumping Arthur's chest as the curtain drops, but Arthur is dead. That same night, as Jeevan walks home from the theater, a terrible flu begins to spread. Hospitals are flooded and Jeevan and his brother barricade themselves inside an apartment, watching out the window as cars clog the highways, gunshots ring out, and life disintegrates around them. <br><br>Fifteen years later, Kirsten is an actress with the Traveling Symphony. Together, this small troupe moves between the settlements of an altered world, performing Shakespeare and music for scattered communities of survivors. Written on their caravan, and tattooed on Kirsten's arm is a line from <em>Star Trek</em>: \"Because survival is insufficient.\" But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who digs graves for anyone who dares to leave. <br><br>Spanning decades, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, this suspenseful, elegiac novel is rife with beauty. As Arthur falls in and out of love, as Jeevan watches the newscasters say their final good-byes, and as Kirsten finds herself caught in the crosshairs of the prophet, we see the strange twists of fate that connect them all. A novel of art, memory, and ambition, <em>Station Eleven</em> tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it. <br><br><em>From the Hardcover edition.</em></p></div>",

Epistolary, introspective, deeply human.<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br><br>A monumental, genre-defying novel over ten years in the making, Michel Faber's The Book of Strange New Things is a masterwork from a writer in full command of his many talents.<br><br>It begins with Peter, a devoted man of faith, as he is called to the mission of a lifetime, one that takes him galaxies away from his wife, Bea. Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter's teachings—his Bible is their \"book of strange new things.\" But Peter is rattled when Bea's letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling. Bea's faith, once the guiding light of their lives, begins to falter. <br><br>Suddenly, a separation measured by an otherworldly distance, and defined both by one newly discovered world and another in a state of collapse, is threatened by an ever-widening gulf that is much less quantifiable. While Peter is reconciling the needs of his congregation with the desires of his strange employer, Bea is struggling for survival. Their trials lay bare a profound meditation on faith, love tested beyond endurance, and our responsibility to those closest to us. <br><br>Marked by the same bravura storytelling and precise language that made The Crimson Petal and the White such an international success, The Book of Strange New Things is extraordinary, mesmerizing, and replete with emotional complexity and genuine pathos.</p></div>",

    "description": "<p>A haunting examination of groupthink and mass hysteria in a rural communityA Penguin Classic   \"I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history,\" Arthur Miller wrote in an introduction to The Crucible, his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria.   In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.   Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \"witch-hunts\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing: \"Political opposition...is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.</p>\n\n<p>\" For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p>",

Holmes, creating a thrilling narrative that will leave readers on the edge of their seats.<br><br><strong>SUMMARY: </strong>Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America’s rush toward the twentieth century. <br><br>The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair’s brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country’s most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. <br><br>The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his “World’s Fair Hotel” just west of the fairgrounds—a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. <br><br>Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. <br><br>What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.The Devil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. In this book the smoke, romance, and mystery of the Gilded Age come alive as never before.<br><br>Erik Larson’s gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.From the Hardcover edition.</p></div>",

Ballard's mesmerizing and ferociously prescient The Drowned World imagines a terrifying future in which solar radiation and global warming has melted the ice caps, and Triassic-era jungles have overrun a submerged and tropical London. Set during the year 2145, the novel follows biologist Dr. Robert Kerans and his team of scientists as they confront a surreal cityscape populated by giant iguanas, albino alligators, and endless swarms of malarial insects. Nature has swallowed all but a few remnants of human civilization, and slowly, Kearns and his companions are transformed--both physically and psychologically--by this prehistoric environment. The Drowned World is both a thrilling adventure and haunting examination of the effects of environmental collapse on the human mind.<br><br><strong>Review<br><br></strong>This is a fascinating read, for it prefigures many of the themes that pervade the author's subsequent books: planetary/ecological disaster, entropy, the devolution of human nature, a preoccupation with the roots of violence. For those unfamiliar with Ballard, it's a good introduction -- more accessible and less transgressive than some of his later work, yet full of the arresting surrealism and hallucinatory brilliance of language that are hallmarks of his writing. <br><br><strong>About the Author<br><br></strong>J.G. Ballard was born in 1930 in Shanghai, where his father was a businessman. After internment in a civilian prison camp, he and his family returned to England in 1946. His 1984 bestseller Empire of the Sun won the Guardian Fiction Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. It was later filmed by Steven Spielberg. His controversial novel Crash was also made into an equally controversial film by David Cronenberg. His most recent novels include the Sunday Times bestsellers Cocaine Nights and Super-Cannes. </p></div>",

The initial seed of this novel was the title that eventually turned into <em>The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England</em>. At first there was no story to go with that title, but I wrote it down and kept coming back to it, wondering what that book could possibly be about.<br><br> Something else I thought about off and on for years was the classic concept of a man waking up in another time and another place, with no idea how he got there. It was when those two ideas came together, and I placed a book with that title into that man’s hands, that this novel was born. I hope you’ll have as much fun with it as I did!</p></div>",

    "description": "<p><strong>The Instant</strong> New York Times <strong>Bestseller!</strong> <strong>Kim Liggett's</strong> The Grace Year <strong>is a speculative thriller in the vein of</strong> The Handmaid’s Tale <strong>and</strong> The Power <strong>.<br />\n</strong><br />\n<strong>Survive the year.<br />\n</strong><br />\nNo one speaks of the grace year. It’s forbidden.   </p>\n<p>In Garner County, girls are told they have the power to lure grown men from their beds, to drive women mad with jealousy. They believe their very skin emits a powerful aphrodisiac, the potent essence of youth, of a girl on the edge of womanhood. That’s why they’re banished for their sixteenth year, to release their magic into the wild so they can return purified and ready for marriage. But not all of them will make it home alive.   </p>\n<p>Sixteen-year-old Tierney James dreams of a better life―a society that doesn’t pit friend against friend or woman against woman, but as her own grace year draws near, she quickly realizes that it’s not just the brutal elements they must fear. It’s not even the poachers in the woods, men who are waiting for a chance to grab one of the girls in order to make a fortune on the black market. Their greatest threat may very well be each other.   </p>\n<p>With sharp prose and gritty realism, <em>The Grace Year</em> examines the complex and sometimes twisted relationships between girls, the women they eventually become, and the difficult decisions they make in-between.  </p>\n<p>“A visceral, darkly haunting fever dream of a novel and an absolute page-turner.” – Libba Bray, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author</p><h3>From School Library Journal</h3>\n<p>Gr 9 Up—At the age of 16, all girls are banished so that they can release their magic, which \"lures men from their beds, makes boys lose their minds, and drives the wives mad with jealousy.\" Before they are sent away, the chosen girls are given a veil signifying that they will be married when—and if—they return. Tierney dreads this \"grace year.\" She has no desire to be married. She has seen the condition of the girls who return. She has no fear of the menial labor she will be assigned if not chosen as a bride. She does receive an unwanted veil and leaves with the rest of the girls and the guards who are to protect them from the poachers who will kill them, dissect them, and sell what's left of them back to the settlement as medicine. The poachers are dangerous, but so are the dynamics of the girls themselves as they fight one another and struggle to survive. This dark tale, often reminiscent of William Golding's Lord of the Flies and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, is both disturbing and uplifting. The cruelty shown by self-appointed leader Kiersten contrasts starkly with Tierney's desire to maintain peace and keep everyone alive. When Tierney is forced out of the encampment and must survive on her own, her resourcefulness proves that magic is not all that they were told it was. While main characters are well drawn, minor characters lack real development. The plot, often harsh and violent, builds to a surprising conclusion, a paean to feminism in some respects. VERDICT This is a novel that will appeal to those who like dark stories with fairy-tale elements; highly recommended as a book group discussion choice.—Janet Hilbun, University of North Texas, Denton</p>\n<h3>Review</h3>\n<p>\"Liggett's immersive storytelling effortlessly weaves horror elements with a harrowing and surprising survival story. Profound moments lie in small details, and readers' hearts will race and break right along with the brave, capable Tierney's. The biggest changes often begin with the smallest rebellions, and the emotional conclusion will resonate. Chilling, poignant, haunting, and unfortunately, all too timely.\" -- <em>Kirkus</em> (Starred Review)  </p>\n<p>\"Beautiful, devastating, and deeply moving, THE GRACE YEAR is a testament to the power of finding your voice and speaking your truth. This story of hope and resistance reminds us of what authoritarians and strongmen throughout history have always feared--that a single light in the darkness calls all other lights to shine, that a lone whisper can give rise to a thundering chorus. This haunting, lyrical book is required reading, full stop.\" -- Samira Ahmed, <em>New York Times</em> Bestselling author of <em>Internment</em> and *Love, Hate &amp; Other Filters *  </p>\n<p>\"A visceral, darkly haunting fever dream of a novel and an absolute page-turner. Liggett's deeply suspenseful book brilliantly explores the high cost of a misogynistic world that denies women power and does it with a heart-in-your-throat, action-driven story that's equal parts horror-laden fairy tale, survival story, romance, and resistance manifesto. I couldn't stop reading.\" -- Libba Bray, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Diviners</em> and <em>A Great and Terrible Beauty</em>  </p>\n<p>\"A dark fairy tale of a book that speaks to the time that we live in.\" -- Kelly Link, author of <em>Get In Trouble</em>  </p>\n<p>\" <em>The Grace Year</em> seethes with love and brutality, violence and hope. It is a remarkable and timely story of the bonds between women, the cost of breaking those bonds, and the courage it takes to defy a patriarchy intent on crushing feminine strength. Everyone should read this book.\" --Sabaa Tahir, #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>An Ember in the Ashes</em>  </p>\n<p>\" <em>The Grace Year</em> is a book for every woman who has ever screamed at the top of her lungs and still felt like no one heard her. A book for every person who has ever been made to feel small or less than. A book for all of us who have been told to sit down and be silent, to grin and bear. Tierney's captivating story reminded me that sometimes existing is itself an act of bravery--and this book's existence is an act of courage that I'm very grateful for. Brutally smart, devastatingly lyrical, and so capital i-Important, I want everyone to read this book!\" -- Jasmine Warga, internationally bestselling author of <em>My Heart and Other Black Holes</em> and <em>Other Words for Home</em>  </p>\n<p>\"It is a top ten book of the year for sure and maybe the best YA novel this year.

    "description": "<div>\n<p><em>For readers drawn to slow-burning literary fiction that explores human dignity ground beneath economic injustice—themes of resilience, compassion, and moral awakening. Ideal if you prefer character-driven narratives with plainspoken lyricism, emotional weight over plot momentum, and the stark beauty of desperate people clinging to hope. (Storygraph)</em><br><br>______<br><br><strong>April 2014 marks the 75th anniversary of the first Viking hardcover publication of Steinbeck's crowning literary achievement.</strong><br><br>First published in 1939, Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads, driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into haves and have-nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. <br><br>A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man's fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman's stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes the very nature of equality and justice in America. <br><br>As Don DeLillo has claimed, Steinbeck \"shaped a geography of conscience\" with this novel where \"there is something at stake in every sentence.\" <br><br>Beyond that--for emotional urgency, evocative power, sustained impact, prophetic reach, and continued controversy--The Grapes of Wrath is perhaps the most American of American classics. </p>\n<p><br>To commemorate the book's 75th anniversary, this volume is modeled on the first edition, featuring the original cover illustration by Elmer Hader and specially designed endpapers by Michael Schwab.</p></div>",

But following the public assassination of a dozen climate criminals, Emi’s mother, Kristina, disappears as a possible suspect, and Emi’s illusions of utopia are shattered. A determined Emi and her father, Larch, journey from their home in Nuuk, Greenland to New York City, now a lightly populated storm-surge outpost built from the ruins of the former metropolis. But they aren’t the only ones looking for Kristina. Thirty years earlier, Larch first came to New York with a team of volunteers to save the city from rising waters and torrential storms. Kristina was on the frontlines of a different battle, fighting massive wildfires that ravaged the western United States. They became part of a movement that changed the world­—The Great Transition—forging a new society and finding each other in process. Alternating between Emi’s desperate search for her mother and a meticulously rendered, heart-stopping account of her parents’ experiences during The Great Transition, this novel beautifully shows how our actions today determine our fate tomorrow. A triumphant debut, The Great Transition is “a book for the present and the future—read this and you will be changed” (Michelle Min Sterling, New York Times bestselling author).</p>",

Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. <br><br>In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos.<br><br>What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. <br><br>Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. --Stanley Wiater</p>\n<p>_____</p>\n<p>The Illustrated Man, a seminal work in Ray Bradbury’s career, whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time’s passage, is available from Simon &amp; Schuster for the first time. <br><br>Ray Bradbury brings wonders alive. For this peerless American storyteller, the most bewitching force in the universe is human nature. In these eighteen startling tales unfolding across a canvas of tattooed skin, living cities take their vengeance, technology awakens the most primal natural instincts, and dreams are carried aloft in junkyard rockets. Provocative and powerful, The Illustrated Man is a kaleidoscopic blending of magic, imagination, and truth—as exhilarating as interplanetary travel, as maddening as a walk in a million-year rain, and as comforting as simple, familiar rituals on the last night of the world.</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p><em>The ideal reader for \"The Invention of Morel\" is someone drawn to enigmatic, philosophical narratives that blend existential romance with speculative sci-fi, appealing to those who relish slow-burning mysteries and introspective explorations of love and immortality. (Storygraph)<br><br>Philosophical sci-fi | Short | Surreal + mysterious</em><br><br>An eerie, mind-bending novella that influenced <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Lost</em>. You might love it if you enjoyed <em>Piranesi</em> and <em>I Who Have Never Known Men</em>.<br><br>______<br><br>Jorge Luis Borges declared The Invention of Morel a masterpiece of plotting, comparable to The Turn of the Screw and Journey to the Center of the Earth. Set on a mysterious island, Bioy’s novella is a story of suspense and exploration, as well as a wonderfully unlikely romance, in which every detail is at once crystal clear and deeply mysterious.<br><br>Inspired by Bioy Casares’s fascination with the movie star Louise Brooks, The Invention of Morel has gone on to live a secret life of its own. Greatly admired by Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, and Octavio Paz, the novella helped to usher in Latin American fiction’s now famous postwar boom. As the model for Alain Resnais and Alain Robbe-Grillet’s Last Year in Marienbad, it also changed the history of film.<br><br>______<br><br>\"The masterpiece among Bioy Casares' short, intense novels is The Invention of Morel, a book that won raves from Borges (who placed it alongside Franz Kafka's The Trial), was called \"perfect\" by Octavio Paz, and inspired one of French cinema's most infamous moviesf, Last Year at Marienbad (1961). Though it was published in 1940, the book's continuing relevance was recently proven when it was featured on Lost — a cameo many viewers perceive as a key to that TV show's plot. But that doesn't mean this is a tough tract unfit for quality beach time... Just know that Morel is a poetic evocation of the experience of love, an inquiry into how we know one another, and a still-relevant examination of how technology has changed our relationship with reality. It's also a great read — one you'll be pressing into the hands of your fellow beach-goers.\" --Boldtype <br><br>______<br><br>The Island of Doctor Moreau inspired this 1940 novella. Set on a mysterious island, <em>The Invention of Morel</em> is a story of suspense and exploration as well as an unlikely romance, where every detail is both crystal clear and deeply mysterious. Susan Jill Levine's revision of Ruth Simm's translation offers a new experience of an uncanny work of genius. </p></div>",

Tolkien composed his own version, now published for the first time, of the great legend of Northern antiquity, in two closely related poems to which he gave the titles The New Lay of the Völsungs and The New Lay of Gudrún.  </p>\n<p>“In the Lay of the Völsungs is told the ancestry of the great hero Sigurd, the slayer of Fáfnir most celebrated of dragons, whose treasure he took for his own; of his awakening of the Valkyrie Brynhild who slept surrounded by a wall of fire, and of their betrothal; and of his coming to the court of the great princes who were named the Niflungs (or Nibelungs), with whom he entered into blood-brotherhood. In that court there sprang great love but also great hate, brought about by the power of the enchantress, mother of the Niflungs, skilled in the arts of magic, of shape-changing and potions of forgetfulness.  </p>\n<p>“In scenes of dramatic intensity, of confusion of identity, thwarted passion, jealousy and bitter strife, the tragedy of Sigurd and Brynhild, of Gunnar the Niflung and Gudrún his sister, mounts to its end in the murder of Sigurd at the hands of his blood-brothers, the suicide of Brynhild, and the despair of Gudrún. In the Lay of Gudrún her fate after the death of Sigurd is told, her marriage against her will to the mighty Atli, ruler of the Huns (the Attila of history), his murder of her brothers the Niflung lords, and her hideous revenge.  </p>\n<p>“Deriving his version primarily from his close study of the ancient poetry of Norway and Iceland known as the Poetic Edda (and where no old poetry exists, from the later prose work the Völsunga Saga), J.R.R. Tolkien employed a verse-form of short stanzas whose lines embody in English the exacting alliterative rhythms and the concentrated energy of the poems of the Edda.”<br />\n— Christopher Tolkien</p>",

So where does the author of a near billion-dollar novel sit? Squarely on the shoulders of his own past work?and Arthur Conan Doyle's. Crichton has borrowed from Conan Doyle before?Rising Sun was Holmes and Watson in Japan?but never so brazenly. The title itself here, the same as that of Conan Doyle's yarn about an equatorial plateau rife with dinos, acknowledges the debt. More enervating are Crichton's self-borrowings: the plot line of this novel reads like an outtake from JP. Instead of bringing his dinos to a city, for instance, Crichton keeps them in the Costa Rican jungle, on an offshore island that was the secret breeding ground for the beasts. Only chaos theoretician Ian Malcolm, among the earlier principals, returns to explore this Lost World, six years after the events of JP; but once again, there's a dynamic paleontologist, a pretty female scientist and two cute kids, boy and girl?the latter even saves the day through clever hacking, just as in JP. Despite stiff prose and brittle characters, Chrichton can still conjure unparalleled dino terror, although the wonder is gone and the attacks are predictable, the pacing perfunctory. But his heart now seems to be not so much in the storytelling as in pedagogy: from start to finish, the novel aims to illustrate Crichton's ideas about extinction?basically, that it occurs because of behavioral rather than environmental changes?and reads like a scientific fable, with pages of theory balancing the hectic action. As science writing, it's a lucid, provocative undertaking; but as an adventure and original entertainment, even though it will sell through the roof, it seems that Crichton has laid a big dinosaur egg. 2,000,000 first printing; BOMC and QPB main selection.",

Dick is a haunting and timely masterpiece that dives into the complexities of history, philosophy, and the blurred lines between reality and alternate realities, making it a must-read for those who enjoy speculative fiction and philosophical inquiry. (StoryGraph)</span><br><br>It's America in 1962. Slavery is legal once again. the few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco the I Ching is as common as the Yellow Pages. All because some 20 years earlier the United States lost a war--and is now occupied jointly by Nazi Germany and Japan. <br><br>This harrowing, Hugo Award-winning novel is the work that established Philip K. Dick as an innovator in science fiction while breaking the barrier between science fiction and the serious novel of ideas. In it Dick offers a haunting vision of history as a nightmare from which it may just be possible to awake.</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p>A Satanic cat. A naked witch. Pontius Pilate. Moscow’s literary elite get their asses handed to them by the Devil. Weird, profound, literary chaos that’s funny, philosophical, and iconic.<br><br>_____<br><br>Surely no stranger work exists in the annals of protest literature than The Master and Margarita. Written during the Soviet crackdown of the 1930s, when Mikhail Bulgakov's works were effectively banned, it wraps its anti-Stalinist message in a complex allegory of good and evil. Or would that be the other way around?<br><br>The book's chief character is Satan, who appears in the guise of a foreigner and self-proclaimed black magician named Woland. Accompanied by a talking black tomcat and a \"translator\" wearing a jockey's cap and cracked pince-nez, Woland wreaks havoc throughout literary Moscow. First he predicts that the head of noted editor Berlioz will be cut off; when it is, he appropriates Berlioz's apartment. (A puzzled relative receives the following telegram: \"Have just been run over by streetcar at Patriarch's Ponds funeral Friday three afternoon come Berlioz.\") Woland and his minions transport one bureaucrat to Yalta, make another one disappear entirely except for his suit, and frighten several others so badly that they end up in a psychiatric hospital. In fact, it seems half of Moscow shows up in the bin, demanding to be placed in a locked cell for protection. Meanwhile, a few doors down in the hospital lives the true object of Woland's visit: the author of an unpublished novel about Pontius Pilate. <br><br>This Master--as he calls himself--has been driven mad by rejection, broken not only by editors' harsh criticism of his novel but, Bulgakov suggests, by political persecution as well. Yet Pilate's story becomes a kind of parallel narrative, appearing in different forms throughout Bulgakov's novel: as a manuscript read by the Master's indefatigable love, Margarita, as a scene dreamed by the poet--and fellow lunatic--Ivan Homeless, and even as a story told by Woland himself. Since we see this narrative from so many different points of view, who is truly its author? Given that the Master's novel and this one end the same way, are they in fact the same book? <br><br>These are only a few of the many questions Bulgakov provokes, in a novel that reads like a set of infinitely nested Russian dolls: inside one narrative there is another, and then another, and yet another. His devil is not only entertaining, he is necessary: \"What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it?\" <br><br>Unsurprisingly--in view of its frequent, scarcely disguised references to interrogation and terror--Bulgakov's masterwork was not published until 1967, almost three decades after his death. Yet one wonders if the world was really ready for this book in the late 1930s, if, indeed, we are ready for it now. Shocking, touching, and scathingly funny, it is a novel like no other. Woland may reattach heads or produce 10-ruble notes from the air, but Bulgakov proves the true magician here. <br><br>The Master and Margarita is a different book each time it is opened. <em>--Mary Park</em></p></div>",

Within nocturnal black and white striped tents awaits a unique experience, a feast for the senses, where one can get lost in a maze of clouds, meander through a lush garden made of ice, stand awestruck as a tattooed contortionist folds herself into a small glass box, and gaze in wonderment at an illusionist performing impossible feats of magic. <br><br>Welcome to Le Cirque des Rêves. Beyond the smoke and mirrors, however, a fierce competition is underway--a contest between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood to compete in \"a game,\" in which each must use their powers of illusion to best the other. Unbeknownst to them, this game is a duel to the death, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. </p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\">From the Hardcover edition.</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p>September 1939. As Warsaw falls to Hitler’s Wehrmacht, Captain Alexander de Milja is recruited by the intelligence service of the Polish underground. His mission: to transport the national gold reserve to safety, hidden on a refugee train to Bucharest. Then, in the back alleys and black-market bistros of Paris, in the tenements of Warsaw, with partizan guerrillas in the frozen forests of the Ukraine, and at Calais Harbor during an attack by British bombers, de Milja fights in the war of the shadows in a world without rules, a world of danger, treachery, and betrayal.<br></p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\">From the Trade Paperback edition.</p>\n<h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>\n<p>With clear, reticent prose and his trademark mastery of historical detail, Furst (Shadow Trade; Night Soldiers) brings vividly to life this WWII-era tale of espionage and bravery, chronicling the work of the Polish underground in Poland, France and the Ukraine. As Warsaw is falling in 1939, Polish Captain Alexander de Milja embarks on a harrowing journey to smuggle the national gold reserves out of the country by rail-the first of many death-defying missions he will undertake for the nascent ZWZ, the Union for Armed Struggle. Under a series of false identities, mingling with the bon vivants of occupied Paris, he later becomes a prized intelligence resource in France, surviving by cunning and passing valuable strategic information to the British. In the novel's final section, de Milja is in even more danger, working as a saboteur based in a Ukrainian forest as the Germans march east. Throughout these dramatic events, Furst's understated narrative is insightful and convincing. The unassuming de Milja-who considers himself merely \"unafraid to die, and lucky so far\"-proves an engaging protagonist. His exploits and the courageous sacrifices of the ordinary patriots who help him are both thrilling and at times inspiring. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p>\n<h3>From Library Journal</h3>\n<p>Capt. Alexander de Milja is a chameleon. A cartographer by profession, de Milja works as an intelligence officer in the Polish underground at the outset of World War II. When the Germans discover de Milja's identity in Poland, he goes to France and later Russia to continue his work. De Milja's disguises are many-he passes as a Russian writer, a Czech coal merchant, and a Polish horse breeder-and he embraces each persona completely as he goes about the business of espionage and sabotage. De Milja comes across as a genuine individual who, in his weaker moments, grapples with his desire to give up the fight. This well-written, realistic novel by the author of A Distant War (LJ 10/1/94) paints a vivid picture of the grayness and despair of the German occupation.

The shocking murder of President William McKinley threw into stark relief the emerging new world order of what would come to be known as the American Century. The President and the Assassin is the story of the momentous years leading up to that event, and of the very different paths that brought together two of the most compelling figures of the era: President William McKinley and Leon Czolgosz, the anarchist who murdered him. </p>\n<p>The two men seemed to live in eerily parallel Americas. McKinley was to his contemporaries an enigma, a president whose conflicted feelings about imperialism reflected the country’s own. Under its popular Republican commander-in-chief, the United States was undergoing an uneasy transition from a simple agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse spreading its influence overseas by force of arms. Czolgosz was on the losing end of the economic changes taking place—a first-generation Polish immigrant and factory worker sickened by a government that seemed focused solely on making the rich richer. With a deft narrative hand, journalist Scott Miller chronicles how these two men, each pursuing what he considered the right and honorable path, collided in violence at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. </p>\n<p>Along the way, readers meet a veritable who’s who of turn-of-the-century America: John Hay, McKinley’s visionary secretary of state, whose diplomatic efforts paved the way for a half century of Western exploitation of China; Emma Goldman, the radical anarchist whose incendiary rhetoric inspired Czolgosz to dare the unthinkable; and Theodore Roosevelt, the vainglorious vice president whose 1898 charge up San Juan Hill in Cuba is but one of many thrilling military adventures recounted here. Rich with relevance to our own era, The President and the Assassin holds a mirror up to a fascinating period of upheaval when the titans of industry grew fat, speculators sought fortune abroad, and desperate souls turned to terrorism in a vain attempt to thwart the juggernaut of change. </p>\n<p>Praise for The President and the Assassin   “[A] panoramic tour de force . . . Miller has a good eye, trained by years of journalism, for telling details and enriching anecdotes.”—The Washington Independent Review of Books   “Even without the intrinsic draw of the 1901 presidential assassination that shapes its pages, Scott Miller’s The President and the Assassin [is] absorbing reading. . . . What makes the book compelling is [that] so many circumstances and events of the earlier time have parallels in our own.”—The Oregonian   “A marvelous work of history, wonderfully written.”—Fareed Zakaria, author of The Post-American World   “A real triumph.”—BookPage   “Fast-moving and richly detailed.”—The Buffalo News   “[A] compelling read.”—The Boston Globe   One of Newsweek’s 10 Must-Read Summer Books</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p>The story itself—the swapping of identities between Edward Tudor, heir to the throne of England, and one of his lowliest subjects, a certain Tom Canty of Offal Court, London—was a neat conceit and one that no one would have doubted Twain would have immense fun spinning out. However, while there are moments in the book of what the critics called Twain’s “burlesque,” this apparently simple story delves deeply into the baseness of the human condition—and examines it closely at both ends of the social spectrum. It is not difficult to imagine wanton cruelty and pain meted out in the slums and low dens of Tudor London. But Twain did not spare the aristocracy; he accused them of cupidity, treachery, and outright violence. Brutality is no less brutal for having been dealt by a finely attired lord of the realm rather than by a drink-soaked mendicant clad in rags, worried that he will not come up with the two pennies required to pay his rent. One has to admit that to Twain’s contemporaries, and to readers today, <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> is not a <em>funny</em> book.<br><br>But it is an exciting one, almost a thriller. Will the deception succeed? Will Tom Canty take the throne? And will Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales (as Twain erroneously styles him), live his life in rags and squalor, raving and raging until his dying day about his own blue blood and the common, ungrateful usurper of the throne? It’s a close thing, and there are times when the reader doubts that Twain will manage to pull off a suitably happy ending.<br><br>Then there is the problem with the language Twain employs. The book is filled with archaic and, in the mouths of the noble characters, flowery language. The more base characters speak a guttural if elaborate patois: “‘Gone stark mad as any Tom o’ Bedlam! . . . But mad or no mad, I and thy Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or I’m no true man!’” (p. 24). The aristocrats are no less orotund, even when condemning one of their own to death: “‘Alack, how I have longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late it commeth, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance. But speed ye, speed ye! let others do this happy office [that is, a beheading] sith ’tis denied to me’” (p. 52). This is not the Mark Twain the reading public was used to—we are a long way from Tom, Huck, and Pudd’nhead. But Twain had always been a meticulous and discerning student of the spoken word, and absent a living example of Tudor speech, he readily admitted reading a great deal of Shakespeare to get the language down for both prince and pauper.<br><br>At first, the language seems a trifle daunting, but it quickly becomes easy to read and in the end adds immeasurably to the authenticity of the book. To have had his characters speak in the manner of Victorian Londoners of his age would have undercut the profound sense of time and place Twain manages to convey so well.<br><br>Having said how much <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> is <em>not</em> a typical example of Twain’s work, it is worth taking a look at the factors that make it, in fact, a comfortable fit with the rest of the Twain canon. Like Tom Canty, the pauper of the story, Twain knew well the privations of youthful poverty. His father, John Marshall Clemens (1798–1847), was an inept businessman, perennially in debt, sometimes bringing his family to such low financial water as to force the selling of family land, and even the household furniture. At one point in Twain’s youth the family was forced to face the humiliation of having to take in boarders. True, Twain never knew the crushing poverty of the Canty clan, but he grew up knowing the cold sting of want.<br><br>Tom Canty’s father is an ogre, a tyrant, a drunkard, and an abuser. Were he alive today his treatment of his family would, more than likely, land him in jail. Twain’s own father, while no monster, was cold, distant, unaffectionate, and, it seems, uninterested in any of his seven children, still less in his wife (Jane Lampton Clemens, 1803–1890), with whom he lived in a loveless marriage. As Twain admits so candidly in a fragment of an autobiography published in 1907: “I had never once seen a member of the Clemens family kiss another one—except once. When my father lay dying in our house in Hannibal he put his arm around my sister’s neck and drew her down and kissed her, saying, ‘Let me die.’” (Paine, A. B. <em>Mark Twain: A Biography</em> , Vol. I, New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1912, p. 73.) It is not difficult to imagine that Twain could take his own experiences of poverty and cruelty and amplify them into the truly ghastly conditions of Tom Canty’s early life.<br><br>As Twain’s reputation grew he was transformed from lowly newspaper reporter into celebrated author. This celebrity allowed him to hobnob with the Great and Good (including the Russian czar, the German kaiser, and the emperor of Austria-Hungary) and to develop a keen eye for the doings of the upper classes. The courts of the nineteenth century were at least as grand, perhaps even more so, than those of Tudor England. Mark Twain was a proud American and a republican, and he scoffed at the very notion of aristocracy, as well as at a type of American traveler of a certain class who fawned over the titled and highborn. However, he did admit: “We are all like—on the inside . . . we dearly like to be noticed by a duke. . . . When a returned American is playing the earlshe has met I can look on silent and unexcited and never offer to call his hand, although I have three kings and a pair of emperors up my sleeve.” (Camfield, p.376.) These crowned heads do more than just pump up an awestruck American Grand Tourist: Twain’s travels in the courts, palaces, and lavish country houses of Europe must have provided grist for his mill and found their way into the pages of <em>The Prince and the Pauper.</em></p></div>",

    "description": "<p>Including brand-new paintings, this is a fully illustrated new edition of the forerunner to The Lord of the Rings, telling the earlier history of Middle-earth, recounting the events of the First and Second Ages, and introducing some of the key characters, such as Galadriel, Elrond, Elendil and the Dark Lord, Sauron.  The Silmarillion is the core of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a collection of narratives ranging in time from the Elder Days of Middle-earth, through the Second Age and the rise of Sauron, to the end of the War of the Ring.    They are set in an age when Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, dwelt in Middle-earth, and the Elves made war upon him in his impenetrable fortress in Angband for the recovery of the Silmarils, three jewels containing the last remaining pure light of Valinor, seized by Morgoth and set in his iron crown.    Accompanying these tales are several shorter works. The Ainulindalë is a myth of the Creation and in the Valaquenta the nature and powers of the gods is described. The Akallabêth recounts the downfall of the great island kingdom of Númenor at the end of the Second Age and Of the Rings of Power tells of the great events at the end of the Third Age, as told in The Lord of the Rings.    Tolkien could not publish The Silmarillion in his lifetime, as it grew with him, so he would leave it to his son, Christopher, to edit the work from many manuscripts and bring his father's great vision to publishable form, so completing the literary achievement of a lifetime. This special edition presents anew this seminal first step towards mapping out the posthumous publishing of Middle-earth, and the beginning of an illustrious forty years and more than twenty books celebrating his father's legacy.    Also included is a letter by J.R.R. Tolkien written in 1951 which provides a brilliant exposition of the earlier Ages, and almost 50 full-colour paintings by Ted Nasmith, including some which appear here for the first time.</p>",

As Fritha grows up, Rhayader and his small sailboat eventually are lost in the Dunkirk evacuation, having saved several hundred men. The bird, which was with Rhayader, returns briefly to the grown Fritha on the marshes. She interprets this as Rhayader's soul taking farewell of her (and realizes she had come to love him). Afterwards, a German pilot destroys Rhayader's lighthouse and all of his work, except for one portrait Fritha saved after his death: a painting of her as Rhayader first saw her – a child, with the injured snow goose in her arms.</p>\n<p><br></p></div>",

Everything about the history of the Society of Jesus bespoke deft and efficient action, exploration and research. During what Europeans were pleased to call the Age of Discovery, Jesuit priests were never more than a year or two behind the men who made initial contact with previously unknown peoples; indeed, Jesuits were often the vanguard of exploration.<br><br>The United Nations required years to come to a decision that the Society of Jesus reached in ten days. In New York, diplomats debated long and hard, with many recesses and tablings of the issue, whether and why human resources should be expended in an attempt to contact the world that would become known as Rakhat when there were so many pressing needs on Earth. In Rome, the questions were not whether or why but how soon the mission could be attempted and whom to send.<br><br>The Society asked leave of no temporal government. It acted on its own principles, with its own assets, on Papal authority. The mission to Rakhat was undertaken not so much secretly as privately–a fine distinction but one that the Society felt no compulsion to explain or justify when the news broke several years later.<br><br>The Jesuit scientists went to learn, not to proselytize. They went so that they might come to know and love God’s other children. They went for the reason Jesuits have always gone to the furthest frontiers of human exploration. They went ad majorem Dei gloriam: for the greater glory of God.<br><br>They meant no harm.</p>\n<p> </p></div>",

As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story from his own childhood. Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues—a bee, a key, and a sword—that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to an ancient library hidden far below the surface of the earth. What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians—it is a place of lost cities and seas, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also of those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose—in both the mysterious book and in his own life.</p>",

When the insurer Lloyds of London pays on the wreck, it takes ownership and plans expeditions to recoup the lost millions in gold and silver. Nearly two hundred years later, after a series of largely failed salvage operations, Lloyds tries again - this time on the strength of new technologies and a strategy devised by the gifted young engineer Henri Poincare. </p>\n<p>It is late spring, 1978. Poincare has worked to near-exhaustion preparing for the Luntine dive. Before the salvage season begins, he takes a rare holiday: a hike at low tide across the vast, muddy flats of the Wadden Sea. His guide is Liesel Kraus - smart, able appealing...and troubled. She and her brother Anselm, directors of Kraus Steel, are haunted by a violent history that generates both rage and an enormous, corrputing wealth. The closer Poincare draws to Liesel and Anselm, the more warped life becomes until love and a death threat compel him to investigate what no one else - aside from Interpol - will. Pain as well as treasure, he discovers, can be dredged up from the past to reshape the present. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenth Witness</em> , a prequel to the award-winning , is the tale of a man upended: a twenty-eight year old who rejects a brilliant career in engineering for an uncertain, darker one: international police work.</p></div>",

Destry is a top network analyst with the Environmental Rescue Team, an ancient organization devoted to preventing ecosystem collapse. On the planet Sask-E, her mission is to terraform an Earthlike world, with the help of her taciturn moose, Whistle. But then she discovers a city that isn't supposed to exist, hidden inside a massive volcano. Torn between loyalty to the ERT and the truth of the planet's history, Destry makes a decision that echoes down the generations. Centuries later, Destry's protege, Misha, is building a planetwide transit system when his worldview is turned upside-down by Sulfur, a brilliant engineer from the volcano city. Together, they uncover a dark secret about the real estate company that's buying up huge swaths of the planet—a secret that could destroy the lives of everyone who isn't Homo sapiens. Working with a team of robots, naked mole rats, and a very angry cyborg cow, they quietly sow seeds of subversion. But when they're threatened with violent diaspora, Misha and Sulfur's very unusual child faces a stark choice: deploy a planet-altering weapon, or watch their people lose everything they've built on Sask-E.</p></div>",

    "description": "<p>The Time Machine by H. G. Wells is a science fiction novel that was first published in 1895. The story follows an unnamed Time Traveller who builds a machine that can transport him through time. He travels to the year 802,701 AD where he encounters two distinct species of human-like creatures, the Eloi and the Morlocks. The Eloi are childlike and peaceful, living above ground in a utopian society, while the Morlocks are savage and cannibalistic, living underground in darkness. Wells uses his narrative to explore the themes of evolution, class struggle, and the dangers of technological advancement. The Time Traveller's journey through time serves as a commentary on the consequences of social and technological progress. The Eloi and the Morlocks represent two extremes of human evolution, with the former being the result of a life of luxury and the latter being the product of a life of labor and hardship. The novel also touches upon the idea of class struggle, with the Eloi representing the upper class who have no need to work and the Morlocks representing the working class who are forced to live in harsh conditions. Wells' portrayal of the Morlocks as cannibalistic monsters highlights the fear of the working class rising up against their oppressors. Furthermore, The Time Machine also warns against the dangers of technological advancement. The Time Traveller's machine represents the pinnacle of human ingenuity, but it also leads him to witness the destruction of humanity. The novel suggests that unchecked technological progress can lead to catastrophic consequences. The Time Machine is a thought-provoking novel that explores complex themes through an engaging narrative. Wells' commentary on social and technological progress is still relevant today, making this novel a timeless classic of science fiction literature.</p>",

All rights reserved.</h3>\n<p>Prologue<br />\nAt the beginning<br />\nOn the shore   </p>\n<p>The storm was shattering.   </p>\n<p>Lightning struck a tree. The trunk split with extraordinary violence, but there was an inevitability to its destruction.   </p>\n<p>So, too, with her. As she was sundered in two, there was no surprise—only pain.   </p>\n<p>She heard herself crack, the ichor in her veins boiling, but then all noise was drowned out by the roar of the storm. In days past she had summoned lightning at a thought; the rain came and went at her command; the waves churned at her whim.   </p>\n<p>But those powers had been taken from her. Now it was she who was at the mercy of the elements, tossed about like a toy. She fought to hold on to the broken parts of herself, but they slipped out of her grasp.   </p>\n<p>Insensibility seized her. She was dragged down into darkness, not grateful, and yet relieved.   </p>\n<p>When she opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was the dark bowl of the night sky. <br />\nFaint stars were scattered across its curved surface, and a full white moon rode the clouds. The air smelt sweetly of rain, but the tempest had passed.   </p>\n<p>Now a hush held the world in the palm of its hand. A low voice rumbled through her bones, monotonous and familiar. It was the voice of the waves, running up the shore and receding.   </p>\n<p>She felt as if she had awakened after a deep, revivifying sleep. She could not remember what had happened before, but that she had suffered she did not doubt. All distress had passed with the storm, however. She felt pleasantly empty—weak, wrung out, but calm.   </p>\n<p>The sand whispered against her as she rose unsteadily to her feet. Before her was the sea. Behind her, the dark mass of the jungle loomed out of the night like a drowsing beast, only half-asleep.   </p>\n<p>She felt her way across the shore, going slowly, for her limbs felt new to her. The beach was scattered with the debris of the storm, and she tripped on a piece of wood, grazing her knee.   </p>\n<p>The silence of the world began to frighten her. She felt alone, abandoned by all she had known—even her own self, for she could not remember what she was called. Trees lined the shore, graceful assemblies of coconut palms and casuarinas. But when she addressed them, they did not answer.   </p>\n<p>She longed for a friendly voice, the touch of a hand she knew. She had been asleep for so long. If only someone would tell her what had happened . . .   </p>\n<p>Her foot knocked against something solid. This log seemed different—solid, but more yielding. She crouched down, reaching out, and felt warm flesh, the jutting edge of bone. The body was breathing. It stirred at her touch.   </p>\n<p>The girl opened her eyes. They gleamed as they caught the light of the moon, and they held the same look she must have on her own face—a look of recognition and relief. “Muna.”   </p>\n<p>“Is that my name?” said Muna, but she was not really questioning it. She had known at once that they belonged to each other. “I have forgotten yours.”   </p>\n<p>“I was called Sakti, I think,” said the other. “Help me up, kak,” she said, calling Muna ‘“sister,”‘ and from then on that was how they addressed each other.   </p>\n<p>Chapter 1 <br />\nSix weeks later  </p>\n<p>The island of Janda Baik, the Straits of Malacca  </p>\n<p>Muna  </p>\n<p>The forests of Janda Baik were imposing even in the full glare of daylight. In the half-light of dawn they were something else altogether-an extrusion of another, inhuman world, beyond terror or awe.  </p>\n<p>The forests blanketed a large part of the island, but the villages clung to the coast. The people of the island went quietly in the shadow of the jungle, avoiding its notice. What came to pass in the jungle was the business of witches and spirits.  </p>\n<p>Of course, such business was precisely Mak Genggang's stock-in-trade. In appearance she was like any aged village woman to be found bent over cooking pots in a kitchen or selling vegetables in a market. Her manner, which combined warmth with an imperiousness that would not have been out of place in a palace, would not distinguish her from any other matriarch in her batik cloths.  </p>\n<p>Yet her appearance was deceptive. As everyone in Janda Baik knew, Mak Genggang was the foremost witch of the region, first among the magicians in the polities along the Straits. The King of Siam himself was said to have sought her counsel; she was renowned among practitioners of the magic arts in China and India; and she counted among her friends England's Sorceress Royal, who presided over the magicians of that distant country. Mak Genggang's name was known even in the Unseen Realm-the hidden world where the spirits live, next door to our own.  </p>\n<p>Despite her great powers she was a kindly woman, but as with many strong people who are not often afraid, it did not come naturally to her to take thought of the fears of the weak. It had been she who insisted that Muna and her sister Sakti depart at the start of the day, before the sun had quite risen.  </p>\n<p>\"Magic is always strongest at a border,\" the witch had explained. \"Whether it be between jungle and village, or earth and sea, or day and night.\"  </p>\n<p>Sakti's face had twitched. Muna had known just how she felt. Left to herself, Muna would not have set off any earlier than noon, when the sun would be high in the sky, its light inescapable.  </p>\n<p>\"We will be guided by your judgment, of course, mak cik,\" Muna said. \"But will not it be easier for us to see our way if we leave later in the day?\"  </p>\n<p>\"The sooner you are off, the better,\" said the witch firmly.  </p>\n<p>They had risen at dawn, when it was dark, and the sky was still a deep blue when they arrived at the edge of the jungle. Under the trees lay a shadowy world, full of mystery and discomfort-leeches, snakes, dangerous beasts . . . and magic. For through the jungle lay the shortest route to the Unseen Realm, the abode of djinns and spirits, whence all magic ultimately flowed.  </p>\n<p>\"If we put you on a ship to England, it would be a year before you saw its shores,\" said Mak Genggang. \"But the Unseen Realm borders all mortal lands, and it will take you no time at all to get there through the jungle. Any fool who wanders in the forest risks stumbling into the world of the spirits, if he does not take care.\"  </p>\n<p>Muna had heard all the usual stories of such fools, and the grisly ends to which they came. The tales were not such as to light in her any flame of desire to model herself on their heroes. \"But is it safe to go this way, mak cik?\"  </p>\n<p>\"Of course it is not safe,\" said Mak Genggang impatiently. \"But it would not be safe for you to remain here either. I shall make a path for you, and if you walk briskly, you will be in England before the Sorceress Royal has sat down to her breakfast.\"  </p>\n<p>The ceremony for the opening of the path was a simple one. Mak Genggang did not chant, nor work any great magic, so far as Muna could tell. She merely bowed her head, muttering and prodding the grass with a stick, as though she were searching for something she had lost.  </p>\n<p>Muna drew her shawl closer around her, shivering at the chill morning air. There must be more to the witch's activities than was apparent to unmagical eyes, for Sakti watched Mak Genggang with interest, seeming to forget her apprehension at the journey ahead.  </p>\n<p>There were only three of them at the forest's edge. No one else in Mak Genggang's household had been told of their departure. Of course Muna saw the need for discretion-it was no one's fault but their own that they were being sent away in secret.  </p>\n<p>Yet she regretted that she could not bid everyone good-bye. Like most persons of importance Mak Genggang boasted a numerous following, though hers was more variegated than was usual. In her substantial wooden house, set back from the rest of the village, resided a shifting population of witches, apprentices, servants, slaves, bondswomen, poor relations, strays of all descriptions and even a number of lamiae.  </p>\n<p>These last had alarmed Muna when she had first joined the witch's household, but use had accustomed her to them. They were not unlike mortal females-which was perhaps not surprising, for lamiae are nothing more than the spectres of women who die nursing a great grievance. The chief point that distinguished them from other women was their predilection for consuming the vitals of humans; they were particularly fond of infants. Those who lived under Mak Genggang's protection were tame, however, observing strict codes of proper behaviour. They were inordinately fond of gossip and prone to quarrelling among themselves-but these were foibles shared by most of the witch's dependents.  </p>\n<p>Yet Muna had grown attached to her fellow servants in the weeks since Mak Genggang had found her and Sakti wandering confused upon the shore, and taken them under her protection. Muna thought wistfully of the girl who slept on the pallet next to hers. She had often wished Puteh would not insist on repeating her conversations with a certain well-favoured youth in the village when Muna wished to sleep, but now she would miss that excitable voice buzzing in her ear. And she would miss Kak Lena, who reigned over Mak Genggang's kitchen. She had promised to teach Muna Mak Genggang's recipe for sambal (a secret as jealously guarded as any of the witch's magic spells), but Muna would never learn it now . . .   </p>\n<p>\"Why do you sniff?\" whispered Sakti, with what for her was unusual percipience.  </p>\n<p>\"It is nothing,\" said Muna, embarrassed. She flicked her tears away with her shawl. \"Only-I was thinking of everyone, you know! Aren't you sorry to leave, adik?\"  </p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Sakti. \"You know I have been longing for something to happen!\"  </p>\n<p>Muna sighed, but she had not really expected any other response from Sakti. She did not doubt they were sisters: how else could Sakti have known her name the moment they woke, though they remembered nothing else of their past lives? Certainly they looked alike-though Sakti was the prettier, with larger eyes, longer lashes and a clearer golden skin-but they seemed to share no other point of resemblance.  </p>\n<p>It was supposed they had been lost at sea during the storm-such a storm as Janda Baik had not seen in living memory, devastating crops and drowning several fishermen. But neither Muna nor Sakti could say what village they were from, nor name their family.  </p>\n<p>\"The shock has chased these things out of your mind,\" Mak Genggang had said, \"but you will remember in time and then we will find your people.\"  </p>\n<p>But they did not remember, though the days passed, turning insensibly into weeks.  </p>\n<p>The lapse of time had not worried Muna. It was inconvenient not to have memories, to be sure-yet life under Mak Genggang's protection was comfortable. Muna had been set to work in the kitchen, and since in the witch's household the art of cookery was as highly developed and esteemed as that of magic, she had found the work of absorbing interest. She had made friends among her fellow servants, and rapidly become part of the life of the house.  </p>\n<p>As for her sister, Sakti had been singled out by Mak Genggang from the outset for her remarkable magical gift. She had been elevated to the rank of apprentice and relieved of the greater part of her domestic duties so that she might devote her time to the study of magic.  </p>\n<p>Muna herself lacked any magical facility, but she was not exercised by this. Magic hardly seemed to make Sakti happy. To be admitted to Mak Genggang's lessons in magic was accounted a great honour-noblemen and princesses had eagerly sought the privilege-but Sakti did not value her good fortune as she ought. Hers was a restless temperament and she chafed under the burden of Mak Genggang's authority.  </p>\n<p>\"The old woman is a tyrant!\" she said to Muna. \"I don't see how you can bring yourself to bow and scrape to her, and say yes, mak cik and no, mak cik as you do.\"  </p>\n<p>The truth was that Muna was fond of Mak Genggang. The witch could be overbearing, but it was natural that one so old and powerful should believe she knew what was best. But to say this to Sakti would only annoy her.  </p>\n<p>\"I find that the fact she is a powerful magician is a great incentive to courtesy,\" said Muna mildly. \"Besides, we are indebted to her. She was under no obligation to take us in.\"  </p>\n<p>Sakti could not deny that the witch had been kind. Mak Genggang had shown no impatience for their departure, as the time passed and they remained at her household. As for Muna, she knew there must be people wondering at their disappearance-family and friends waiting for their return-but since she could not remember them, she felt no urgent need of a reunion. She should happily have remained with Mak Genggang indefinitely . . . if not for the curse.  </p>\n<p>She glanced at Sakti's waist, but the evidence of the curse was concealed by Sakti's sarong. The recollection of the wound made Muna soften towards her sister. Why should Sakti regret to leave a place that had served her so ill? Muna could only hope that England would suit her better.  </p>\n<p>Mak Genggang straightened, tossing her stick away and clapping her hands. \"There! That will keep you as safe as you can hope to be in djinn-country. And I have laid speech-magic on each of you, so you ought not to have any difficulty speaking with the English.\"  </p>\n<p>The path unfurled before their feet: a silver rope of light, winding across the grass and into the jungle. Sakti and Muna regarded it in some doubt. Mak Genggang's businesslike manner did not quite suffice to persuade them that to stroll into the Unseen World was nothing out of the ordinary way.  </p>\n<p>\"What shall we do if we encounter any spirits?\" ventured Sakti.  </p>\n<p>\"I have taught you spells for defence. You will not have forgot them all, surely?\" said Mak Genggang.  </p>\n<p>\"No, but-\"  </p>\n<p>\"You should not have need of them in any event, so long as you keep to the path. Few spirits will offer to molest you if they know you are under my protection,\" said Mak Genggang. \"You must be discreet, however. The Queen of the Djinns has never minded what we do here in Janda Baik, but she has quarrelled with the English, and that has made her particular about who may travel between her realm and England. But if you are quick and quiet there is no reason she should ever know you have passed through her lands.  </p>\n<p>\"You had best get along,\" she added, when Muna and Sakti still evinced an inclination to linger. \"I have other business to attend to-and we don't want the English to come and find you still here. It would be just like their wickedness to surprise us! Go in safety, and give my regards to the Sorceress Royal and her young man. And mind you look after your sister!\"  </p>\n<p>It would have been natural for the witch to have been addressing Sakti, since it was Sakti who had magic and was best equipped to defend them against the various perils of the Unseen. Yet Mak Genggang looked at Muna.  </p>\n<p>\"I shall watch over my sister, mak cik,\" said Muna. She hesitated. \"Thank you. You have been very good to us!\"  </p>\n<p>They set off. Muna did not mean to look back, for she had a suspicion she would disgrace herself if she did. Yet she turned despite herself.  </p>\n<p>Though they had only advanced a dozen steps into the jungle, already the crowding trees obscured her view. Through the gaps between the boles, she caught a glimpse of the witch still standing there-a small, upright figure, deceptively frail, shading her eyes with one hand.</p>",

Today, The Trumpeter of Krakow is as absorbing and dramatic as when it was first published in 1928. Filled with mystery and excitement, the book is much more than a rousing adventure story. Out of his great love of Poland and its history, Mr. Kelly painted a vivid picture of the political and social life of Krakow in the early Renaissance. For the thousands who already know and love it - and for those who have yet to come under its spell - Macmillan is proud to present this handsome new edition of The Trumpeter of Krakow. Outstanding illustrations by Janina Domanska and a special foreword by Louise Seaman Bechtel, founder and long-time Department Head of the Macmillan Children's Book Department and for many years reviewer of children's books for the New York Herald Tribune, both celebrate and enhance the classic stature of the book.

The better question would be: Where don’t I?</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\">Many people know that The Passage was born from a challenge laid down by my eight-year-old daughter to write the story of “a girl who saves the world.” This wasn’t exactly what I wanted to hear—it seemed a trifle ambitious—but a dare is a dare. For the next three months she joined me on my daily jog, following along on her bicycle, while the two of us hashed out the plot. As the weeks passed, I realized we were onto something much better than the book I was supposed to be writing. I put that book aside, wrote the first chapter of The Passage, and never looked back. </p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\">So don’t ever think you shouldn’t listen to your kids.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\">But my daughter’s challenge wasn’t the only inspiration. When I write a novel, my goal is to put absolutely everything I have into its pages, right down to the interesting thing that happened yesterday. I know I’m done when my mind feels as empty as a leaky bucket. So many influences, real and imagined, went into The Passage that I couldn’t list them if I tried. But one memory that stands out is the night my family and I tried to flee Houston in advance of hurricane Rita. Apparently, about a million other people had the same idea. After five hours on the road, we’d made it all of sixty miles. The highways were clogged with cars that had long since run out of gas; every minimart and gas station had been picked clean. I jumped the median and made it home in a little under an hour, my gas gauge floating just above ‘E’.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\">Rita missed Houston, slamming into a less-inhabited section of Texas and Louisiana coastline. But the experience of being in a large urban evacuation, with its feeling of barely-bottled panic, was one I’ll never forget, and is everywhere in the pages of The Passage.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\">So where did The Twelve come from?</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\">Again, many places. But if I had to pick one source, it would be the strong women in my life. No bones about it: Gentlemen, if you doubt for a second that women are tougher than we are, go watch one have a baby. So here you have Alicia, the woman warrior with her blades and crossbow; here you have Amy, the spiritual leader and visionary; here you have one of my favorite new characters, Lore DeVeer, whose mechanical savvy is matched only by her unbridled sensuality; here you have a fourth woman (sorry, can’t tell you who) whose maternal strength is as powerful as any great spectacle of nature. As I wrote The Twelve, I came to understand that these powerful characters were the backbone of the tale. Even more, they are a tribute to all the amazing women I am privileged to know, befriend, and in one very lucky instance, marry.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\">Hope you enjoy The Twelve. All eyes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-style: italic\">Review</h3>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic\"><strong>PRAISE FOR JUSTIN CRONIN’S *THE PASSAGE<br> <br>Named one of the Ten Best Novels of the Year by Time and Library Journal, and one of the Best Books of the Year by The Washington Post • Esquire • U.S. News &amp; World Report • NPR/*On Point • St. Louis Post-Dispatch<br></strong> <br>“Magnificent . . .

Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person’s decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins. <br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2020 by </strong><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic\">O, the Oprah Magazine, The Washington Post, Harper's Bazaar, Buzzfeed, Vogue, PureWow, New York Magazine</span><strong> and more</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: bold\">\"Bennett's tone and style recalls James Baldwin and Jacqueline Woodson, but it's especially reminiscent of Toni Morrison's 1970 debut novel, <em>The Bluest Eye.\"</em> —Kiley Reid, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> </li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: bold\">\"A page-turner.\" —<em>O, The Oprah Magazine</em></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic\">\"Sure to be one of 2020s best and boldest.\" –Elle</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic\">From The New York Times-bestselling author of The Mothers, a stunning new novel about twin sisters, inseparable as children, who ultimately choose to live in two very different worlds, one black and one white.</li></ul></div>",

Joseph Kavanagh, a new Defender, has one task: to protect his section of the Wall from the Others, the desperate souls who are trapped amid the rising seas outside and are a constant threat. Failure will result in death or a fate perhaps worse: being put to sea and made an Other himself. Beset by cold, loneliness, and fear, Kavanagh tries to fulfill his duties to his demanding Captain and Sergeant, even as he grows closer to his fellow Defenders. A dark part of him wonders whether it would be interesting if something did happen, if they came, if he had to fight for his life...</p>\n<p><br>John Lanchester--acclaimed as \"an elegant and wonderfully witty writer\" (<em>New York Times</em>) and \"a writer of rare intelligence\" (<em>Los Angeles Times</em>)--has written a taut, hypnotic novel of a broken world and what might be found when all is lost. <em>The Wall</em> blends the most compelling issues of our time--rising waters, rising fear, rising political division--into a suspenseful story of love, trust, and survival.</p></div>",

Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe discovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's road. All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived. Under her tutelage, Kvothe learns much about true magic and the ways of women.

    "description": "<div>\n<p>Chinua Achebe is considered the father of modern African literature, the writer who \"opened the magic casements of African fiction.<br><br>\"The African Trilogy--comprised of <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, <em>Arrow of God</em>, and <em>No Longer at Ease</em>--is his magnum opus. In these masterly novels, Achebe brilliantly imagines the lives of three generations of an African community as their world is upended by the forces of colonialism from the first arrival of the British to the waning days of empire.<br><br>The trilogy opens with the groundbreaking Things Fall Apart, the tale of Okonkwo, a hero in his village, whose clashes with missionaries--coupled with his own tragic pride--lead to his fall from grace. Arrow of God takes up the ongoing conflict between continuity and change as Ezeulu, the headstrong chief priest, finds his authority is under threat from rivals and colonial functionaries. But he believes himself to be untouchable and is determined to lead his people, even if it is towards their own destruction. Finally, in No Longer at Ease, Okonkwo's grandson, educated in England, returns to a civil-service job in Lagos, only to see his morality erode as he clings to his membership in the ruling elite. <br><br>Drawing on the traditional Igbo tales of Achebe's youth, The African Trilogy is a literary landmark, a mythic and universal tale of modern Africa. As Toni Morrison wrote, \"African literature is incomplete and unthinkable without the works of Chinua Achebe. For passion, intellect and crystalline prose, he is unsurpassed.\"</p></div>",

    "description": "<p><strong>WINNER OF THE 2023 INTERNATIONAL BOOKER PRIZE<br />\n</strong> New Yorker **• Best Books of 2022  </p>\n<p>An award-winning international sensation―with a second-act dystopian twist―<strong>Time Shelter </strong>is a tour de force set in a world clamoring for the past before it forgets.**</p>\n<p>“At one point they tried to calculate when time began, when exactly the earth had been created,” begins <em>Time Shelter</em> ’s enigmatic narrator, who will go unnamed. “In the mid–seventeenth century, the Irish bishop Ussher calculated not only the exact year, but also a starting date: October 22, 4,004 years before Christ.” But for our narrator, time as he knows it begins when he meets Gaustine, a “vagrant in time” who has distanced his life from contemporary reality by reading old news, wearing tattered old clothes, and haunting the lost avenues of the twentieth century.</p>\n<p>In an apricot-colored building in Zurich, surrounded by curiously planted forget-me-nots, Gaustine has opened the first “clinic for the past,” an institution that offers an inspired treatment for Alzheimer’s sufferers: each floor reproduces a past decade in minute detail, allowing patients to transport themselves back in time to unlock what is left of their fading memories. Serving as Gaustine’s assistant, the narrator is tasked with collecting the flotsam and jetsam of the past, from 1960s furniture and 1940s shirt buttons to nostalgic scents and even wisps of afternoon light. But as the charade becomes more convincing, an increasing number of healthy people seek out the clinic to escape from the dead-end of their daily lives―a development that results in an unexpected conundrum when the past begins to invade the present. Through sharply satirical, labyrinth-like vignettes reminiscent of Italo Calvino and Franz Kafka, the narrator recounts in breathtaking prose just how he became entrenched in a plot to stop time itself.</p>\n<p>“A trickster at heart, and often very funny” (Garth Greenwell, <em>The New Yorker</em> ), prolific Bulgarian author Georgi Gospodinov masterfully stalks the tragedies of the last century, including our own, in what becomes a haunting and eerily prescient novel teeming with ideas. Exquisitely translated by Angela Rodel, <em>Time Shelter</em> is a truly unforgettable classic from “one of Europe’s most fascinating and irreplaceable novelists” (Dave Eggers).</p>\n<p>19 black-and-white drawings</p><h3>Review</h3>\n<p>\"In this antic fantasy of European politics, narrated by a fictionalized version of the author, an enigmatic friend of his designs 'a clinic of the past,' which soothes Alzheimer’s patients with environments from a time they can still remember.... 'History is still news,' Gospodinov writes, cunningly drawing attention to the violence that the past wreaks on the present.\"<br />\n― New Yorker <strong>, \"Best Books of 2022\"</strong>  </p>\n<p>\"The morality of artificially returning people to the past, and the broader question of whether this truly brings solace ― whether indulgence in nostalgia is curative or pernicious ― is the central question of Georgi Gospodinov’s newly translated novel… Adroit execution of such wordplay is a testament to the talent of the novel’s translator, Angela Rodel. [Gospodinov] is sympathetic to the poignancy of things from before ― obsolete objects, old brands of coffee, the skipping of antique records ― but rebuffs the scapegoats of globalism, immigration and modernization that supposedly killed them off; we are all complicit in the destruction of history, and going backward can only mean intolerance and the exaltation of traditionalist kitsch. It’s impossible, when reading all this, not to think of the reactionary sentiments behind Brexit and MAGA and even Putin’s Greater Russia irredentism, but Gospodinov is too delicate to resort to crude political satire.… Touching and intelligent.\"<br />\n― <strong>Adrian Nathan West,</strong> New York Times Book Review  </p>\n<p>\"Mr. Gospodinov, one of Bulgaria’s most popular contemporary writers, is a nostalgia artist. In the manner of Orhan Pamuk and Andreï Makine, his books are preoccupied with memory, its ambiguous pleasures and its wistful, melancholy attraction....This difficult but rewarding novel concludes with an image of Europe brought to the brink of renewed conflict―an abstraction that recent events have imbued with the terrible force of reality.\"<br />\n― <strong>Sam Sacks,</strong> Wall Street Journal  </p>\n<p>\"A chronicle of time itself: this is the ambitious task undertaken by Georgi Gospodinov, Bulgaria’s greatest living writer and annalist of an entire nation’s endless complaints and missed chances, in his Strega Prize–winning novel <em>Time Shelter</em>.... Finished in Berlin just as COVID was on the verge of sweeping through Europe, the novel is at times unnervingly prescient as it issues warnings against the perils of infection ― physical, political, even metaphysical.... A poet at heart, Gospodinov can also write a novel in a single sentence: ‘The past is my home country….’ He uses the absurdities of the very specific universe of Bulgarian pain, of Bulgarian provincial poverty, to unveil deep wounds…. Angela Rodel, the most prolific and accomplished translator of Bulgarian literature into English, carries over Gospodinov’s grand, flowing Bulgarian sentences… into vivid English…. Rodel is part of a grouping of extraordinary women translators working to preserve linguistic diversity.... who are today producing and exporting some of the most compelling and interesting contemporary literature from Bulgaria.\"<br />\n― <strong>Isadora Angel,</strong> Astra  </p>\n<p>\"[An] antic fantasy of European politics.... 'History is still news,' Gospodinov writes, cunningly drawing attention to the violence that the past wreaks on the present.\"<br />\n― The New Yorker  </p>\n<p>\"Gospodinov’s digressive, philosophical novel is less a work of realist literature than an allegory about the perils of looking backward and attempting to make Switzerland (or Sweden or Germany...) great again . . . translator Rodel keeps the narrator’s wry voice consistent . . . And in its brisker latter chapters, the story achieves a pleasurably Borges-ian strangeness while sending a warning signal about how memory can be glitch-y and dangerous . . . An ambitious, quirky, time-folding yarn.\"<br />\n― Kirkus Reviews  </p>\n<p>\"A radical new therapy tests the power of nostalgia in the electric and fantastical latest from Gospodinov ( <em>The Physics of Sorrow</em> ).The clever prose sells the zany premise and imbues it with poignant longing: 'Everything happens years after it has happened.... Most likely 1939 did not exist in 1939, there were just mornings when you woke up with a headache, uncertain and afraid.' Thought-provoking and laced with potent satire, this deserves a spot next to Kafka.\"<br />\n― Publishers Weekly  </p>\n<p>\"The elegant translation and the short, lyrical chapters in this dystopian tale offer a poignant ode to the dual tragedies of personal and universal memory loss.\"<br />\n― <strong>Lucy Lockley,</strong> Booklist</p>\n<h3>From the Back Cover</h3>\n<p>“Georgi Gospodinov is unique in many ways. I’ve been reading him since the beginning and I know that no one can combine an intriguing concept, wonderful imagination, and perfect writing technique like he can.”<br />\n<strong>―Olga Tokarczuk, Nobel Prize–winning author of</strong> Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead</p>\n<p>“Gospodinov is one of Europe's most fascinating and irreplaceable novelists, and this his most expansive, soulful and mind-bending book.\"<br />\n<strong>―Dave Eggers</strong></p>\n<p>“In equal measure playful and profound, Georgi Gospodinov's <em>Time Shelter</em> renders the philosophical mesmerizing, and the everyday extraordinary. I loved it.”<br />\n<strong>―Claire Messud</strong></p>\n<p>“In this book, time sneaks away and then returns, reconstituted. Franz Ferdinand is re-assassinated. The cigarettes you liked as a teenager are on sale again. Communism is back, and nice. The book is a satire, witty and scorching, but it is also wise and tender. Your grandmother is there.”<br />\n<strong>―Joan Acocella,</strong> The New Yorker <strong>staff writer</strong></p>\n<p>“Gospodinov writes like a botanist of the soul: he knows the effects of the pretty mushrooms and the hidden herbs within ourselves in spite of what they look like from afar. The living beings he studies are our versions of our past, the unretrievable, the recreated, the future versions of our past, and how we imbue them with the fantasies and poisons that we cultivate in silence.”<br />\n<strong>―Yuri Herrera, author of</strong> Signs Preceding the End of the World</p>\n<p>“ <em>Time Shelter</em> is an extraordinary romp through time and memory, a beautifully written and wonderfully inventive meditation on what the past means to us, whether we can recapture it, and how it defines our present. This is the perfect novel for these cloistered, atemporal times.”<br />\n<strong>―Alberto Manguel, author of</strong> A History of Reading</p>\n<p>“A powerful and brilliant novel: clear-sighted, foreboding, enigmatic . . . in which the future gives way like a rotten beam, and the past rushes in like a flood.”<br />\n<strong>―Sandro Veronesi, author of</strong> The Hummingbird</p>\n<h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p><strong>Georgi Gospodinov</strong> is one of Bulgaria’s most lauded authors. His novel <em>Time Shelter</em> won the International Booker Prize and the Premio Strega Europeo, among other prizes.</p>\n<p><strong>Angela Rodel</strong> is a prolific translator of Bulgarian literature and won the International Booker Prize for translation.</p>",

Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s.

It was also named the best novel of the twentieth century by librarians across the country ( <em>Library Journal</em> ).

Set in Paris in the 1930s, it features a starving American writer who lives a bohemian life among prostitutes, pimps, and artists. Banned in the US and the UK for more than thirty years because it was considered pornographic, Tropic of Cancer continued to be distributed in France and smuggled into other countries. When it was first published in the US in 1961, it led to more than 60 obscenity trials until a historic ruling by the Supreme Court defined it as a work of literature. Long hailed as a truly liberating book, daring and uncompromising, Tropic of Cancer is a cornerstone of modern literature that asks us to reconsider everything we know about art, freedom, and morality.'At last an unprintable book that is fit to read' Ezra Pound 'A momentous event in the history of modern writing' Samuel Beckett 'The book that forever changed the way American literature would be written' Erica Jong Henry Miller (1891-1980) is one of the most important American writers of the 20th century. His best-known novels include Tropic of Cancer (1934), Tropic of Capricorn (1939), and the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy (Sexus, 1949, Plexus, 1953, and Nexus, 1959), all published in France and banned in the US and the UK until 1964. He is widely recognised as an irreverent, risk-taking writer who redefined the novel and made the link between the European avant-garde and the American Beat generation.</p>",

He is a legendary Wall Street tycoon; she is the brilliant daughter of eccentric aristocrats. Together, they have risen to the very top of a world of seemingly endless wealth. But the secrets around their affluence and grandeur excites gossip. Rumors about Benjamin’s financial maneuvers and Helen’s reclusiveness start to spread—all as a decade of excess and speculation draws to an end.

But it isn’t the only version.<br><br>Hernan Diaz’s Trust brilliantly puts the story of these characters into conversation with other accounts—and in tension with the life and perspective of a young woman bent on disentangling fact from fiction. The result is a novel that becomes more exhilarating and profound with each new layer and revelation. Provocative and propulsive, Trust engages the reader in a quest for the truth while confronting the reality-warping gravitational pull of money and how power often manipulates facts.

Perfect if you like slow, research-rich narratives, contemplative tone, and the hush of forests more than urgent polemics—readers who relish science illuminated through wonder, travel sketches, and the patient language of observation.</em><br><br><strong>A compelling global exploration of nature and survival as seen via a dozen species of trees that represent the challenges facing our planet, and the ways that scientists are working urgently to save our forests and our future.<br><br></strong>The world today is undergoing the most rapid environmental transformation in human history—from climate change to deforestation. Scientists, ethnobotanists, indigenous peoples, and collectives of all kinds are closely studying trees and their biology to understand how and why trees function individually and collectively in the ways they do. In <em>Twelve Trees</em>, Daniel Lewis, curator and historian at one of the world's most renowned research libraries, travels the world to learn about these trees in their habitats.<br><br>Lewis takes us on a sweeping journey to plant breeding labs, botanical gardens, research facilities, deep inside museum collections, to the tops of tall trees, underwater, and around the Earth, journeying into the deserts of the American west and the deep jungles of Peru, to offer a globe-spanning perspective on the crucial impact trees have on our entire planet. When a once-common tree goes extinct in the wild but survives in a botanical garden, what happens next? How can scientists reconstruct lost genomes and habitats? How does a tree store thousands of gallons of water, or offer up perfectly preserved insects from millions of years ago, or root itself in muddy swamps and remain standing? How does a 5,000-year-old tree manage to live, and what can we learn from it? And how can science account for the survival of one species at the expense of others? To study the science of trees is to study not just the present, but the story of the world, its past, and its future.</p></div>",

It is the story of Professor Pierre Aronnax who sets off aboard an American frigate to investigate a series of attacks, which has been reported to be made by an amphibious monster. The monster in question is actually the submarine vessel the 'Nautilus, ' which is commanded by the eccentric Captain Nemo. When the Nautilus destroys the Professor's ship, he is taken prisoner by Captain Nemo along with his trusted servant Conseil and the frigate's harpooner Ned Land. What follows for the three is a tale of great adventure and scientific wonder. An early pioneer of science fiction, Jules Verne's work is noted for its prediction of scientific advancements. In the case of \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\" Verne accurately forecasted the development of submarine vessels. It is at once a harbinger of technology to come and captivating tale of adventure which has delighted readers ever since its original publication.

One of Europe's leading young thinkers shows how we can build an ideal world today.<br><br></strong>\"A more politically radical Malcolm Gladwell.\" -- <em>New York Times<br><br></em>After working all day at jobs we often dislike, we buy things we don't need. Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian, reminds us it needn't be this way -- and in some places it isn't. Rutger Bregman's TED Talk about universal basic income seemed impossibly radical when he delivered it in 2014. A quarter of a million views later, the subject of that video is being seriously considered by leading economists and government leaders the world over. It's just one of the many utopian ideas that Bregman proves is possible today. <br><br><em>Utopia for Realists</em> is one of those rare books that takes you by surprise and challenges what you think can happen. From a Canadian city that once completely eradicated poverty, to Richard Nixon's near implementation of a basic income for millions of Americans, Bregman takes us on a journey through history, and beyond the traditional left-right divides, as he champions ideas whose time have come. <br><br>Every progressive milestone of civilization -- from the end of slavery to the beginning of democracy -- was once considered a utopian fantasy. Bregman's book, both challenging and bracing, demonstrates that new utopian ideas, like the elimination of poverty and the creation of the fifteen-hour workweek, can become a reality in our lifetime. Being unrealistic and unreasonable can in fact make the impossible inevitable, and it is the only way to build the ideal world.</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p><em>A surprisingly epic tale of rabbits fleeing destruction, grappling with leadership, survival, and belief. Yes, it’s about rabbits — but it’s dark, thoughtful, and deeply immersive.<br></em><br>_____<br><br><strong>Discover—or revisit—the enchanting world of the Sandleford Warren rabbits in this first-ever illustrated edition of a celebrated modern classic.</strong> <br><br>A phenomenal worldwide bestseller for almost forty years, Richard Adams’s <em>Watership Down</em> is a timeless classic and one of the most beloved novels of all time. Set in England’s Downs, a once idyllic rural landscape, this stirring tale of adventure, courage, and survival follows a band of very special rabbits on their flight from the intrusion of man and the certain destruction of their home. Led by a stouthearted pair of brothers, they journey forth from their native Sandleford Warren through the harrowing trials posed by predators and adversaries, to a mysterious promised land and a more perfect society. <br><br>A book that speaks to our society as vividly as it did nearly half a century ago, this keepsake Scribner Classic edition showcases more than twenty sumptuous, evocative tip-in paintings from Aldo Galli, an illustrator chosen by Richard Adams himself.</p>\n<h3>Review</h3>\n<p>To capture the feeling of the verdant English landscape in Richard Adams's \"Watership Down\" (Atheneum, 496 pages, $29.99), first published in 1972, Aldo Galli painted in the real locations described in the story. In his finely wrought illustrations, the rabbits Hazel and Pipkin crouch beside the real Nuthanger Farm and Hazel, Bigwig and Fiver make their way across the real Hampshire downs. Mr. Galli brings a sense of intensified realism to his depictions in this 40th anniversary edition. Foliage is luxuriantly, impossibly green, and the edges of things—the feathers of birds, the fluff of dandelions—look as sharp as if they were cut from glass. <strong>As a gift, this edition would suit anyone over the age of 10, including adults.</strong> ― <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></p>\n<h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p>Richard Adams (1920–2016) was educated at Bradfield College and Worcester College, Oxford. He served in the Second World War and in 1948 joined the civil service. In the mid-1960s he completed his first novel, <em>Watership Down</em> , for which he struggled for several years to find a publisher. It was eventually awarded both the Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Award for children’s fiction for 1972. He would go on to publish several more books, including <em>Shardik</em> , <em>Tales from Watership Down</em> , <em>Maia</em> , <em>The Plague Dogs</em> , and <em>The Girl in a Swing</em>.</p>\n<h3>Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.</h3>\n<p>Watership Down 1 The Notice Board <br>CHORUS: </p>\n<p>Why do you cry out thus, unless at some vision of horror? </p>\n<p>CASSANDRA: </p>\n<p>The house reeks of death and dripping blood. </p>\n<p>CHORUS: </p>\n<p>How so? ’Tis but the odor of the altar sacrifice. </p>\n<p>CASSANDRA: </p>\n<p>The stench is like a breath from the tomb. </p>\n<p>Aeschylus, Agamemnon </p>\n<p>The primroses were over. Toward the edge of the wood, where the ground became open and sloped down to an old fence and a brambly ditch beyond, only a few fading patches of pale yellow still showed among the dog’s mercury and oak-tree roots. On the other side of the fence, the upper part of the field was full of rabbit holes. In places the grass was gone altogether and everywhere there were clusters of dry droppings, through which nothing but the ragwort would grow. A hundred yards away, at the bottom of the slope, ran the brook, no more than three feet wide, half choked with kingcups, watercress and blue brooklime. The cart track crossed by a brick culvert and climbed the opposite slope to a five-barred gate in the thorn hedge. The gate led into the lane. </p>\n<p>The May sunset was red in clouds, and there was still half an hour to twilight. The dry slope was dotted with rabbits—some nibbling at the thin grass near their holes, others pushing further down to look for dandelions or perhaps a cowslip that the rest had missed. Here and there one sat upright on an ant heap and looked about, with ears erect and nose in the wind. But a blackbird, singing undisturbed on the outskirts of the wood, showed that there was nothing alarming there, and in the other direction, along the brook, all was plain to be seen, empty and quiet. The warren was at peace. </p>\n<p>At the top of the bank, close to the wild cherry where the blackbird sang, was a little group of holes almost hidden by brambles. In the green half-light, at the mouth of one of these holes, two rabbits were sitting together side by side. At length, the larger of the two came out, slipped along the bank under cover of the brambles and so down into the ditch and up into the field. A few moments later the other followed. </p>\n<p>The first rabbit stopped in a sunny patch and scratched his ear with rapid movements of his hind leg. Although he was a yearling and still below full weight, he had not the harassed look of most “outskirters”—that is, the rank and file of ordinary rabbits in their first year who, lacking either aristocratic parentage or unusual size and strength, get sat on by their elders and live as best they can—often in the open—on the edge of their warren. He looked as though he knew how to take care of himself. There was a shrewd, buoyant air about him as he sat up, looked round and rubbed both front paws over his nose. As soon as he was satisfied that all was well, he laid back his ears and set to work on the grass. </p>\n<p>His companion seemed less at ease. He was small, with wide, staring eyes and a way of raising and turning his head which suggested not so much caution as a kind of ceaseless, nervous tension. His nose moved continually, and when a bumblebee flew humming to a thistle bloom behind him, he jumped and spun round with a start that sent two nearby rabbits scurrying for holes before the nearest, a buck with black-tipped ears, recognized him and returned to feeding. </p>\n<p>“Oh, it’s only Fiver,” said the black-tipped rabbit, “jumping at bluebottles again. Come on, Buckthorn, what were you telling me?” </p>\n<p>“Fiver?” said the other rabbit. “Why’s he called that?” </p>\n<p>“Five in the litter, you know: he was the last—and the smallest. You’d wonder nothing had got him by now. I always say a man couldn’t see him and a fox wouldn’t want him. Still, I admit he seems to be able to keep out of harm’s way.”* </p>\n<p>The small rabbit came closer to his companion, lolloping on long hind legs. </p>\n<p>“Let’s go a bit further, Hazel,” he said. “You know, there’s something queer about the warren this evening, although I can’t tell exactly what it is. Shall we go down to the brook?” </p>\n<p>“All right,” answered Hazel, “and you can find me a cowslip. If you can’t find one, no one can.” </p>\n<p>He led the way down the slope, his shadow stretching behind him on the grass. They reached the brook and began nibbling and searching close beside the wheel ruts of the track. </p>\n<p>It was not long before Fiver found what they were looking for. Cowslips are a delicacy among rabbits, and as a rule there are very few left by late May in the neighborhood of even a small warren. This one had not bloomed and its flat spread of leaves was almost hidden under the long grass. They were just starting on it when two larger rabbits came running across from the other side of the nearby cattle wade. </p>\n<p>“Cowslip?” said one. “All right—just leave it to us. Come on, hurry up,” he added, as Fiver hesitated. “You heard me, didn’t you?” </p>\n<p>“Fiver found it, Toadflax,” said Hazel. </p>\n<p>“And we’ll eat it,” replied Toadflax. “Cowslips are for Owsla†—don’t you know that? If you don’t, we can easily teach you.” </p>\n<p>Fiver had already turned away. Hazel caught him up by the culvert. </p>\n<p>“I’m sick and tired of it,” he said. “It’s the same all the time. ‘These are my claws, so this is my cowslip.’ ‘These are my teeth, so this is my burrow.’ I’ll tell you, if ever I get into the Owsla, I’ll treat outskirters with a bit of decency.” </p>\n<p>“Well, you can at least expect to be in the Owsla one day,” answered Fiver. “You’ve got some weight coming and that’s more than I shall ever have.” </p>\n<p>“You don’t suppose I’ll leave you to look after yourself, do you?” said Hazel. “But to tell you the truth, I sometimes feel like clearing out of this warren altogether. Still, let’s forget it now and try to enjoy the evening. I tell you what—shall we go across the brook? There’ll be fewer rabbits and we can have a bit of peace. Unless you feel it isn’t safe?” he added. </p>\n<p>The way in which he asked suggested that he did in fact think that Fiver was likely to know better than himself, and it was clear from Fiver’s reply that this was accepted between them. </p>\n<p>“No, it’s safe enough,” he answered. “If I start feeling there’s anything dangerous I’ll tell you. But it’s not exactly danger that I seem to feel about the place. It’s—oh, I don’t know—something oppressive, like thunder: I can’t tell what; but it worries me. All the same, I’ll come across with you.” </p>\n<p>They ran over the culvert. The grass was wet and thick near the stream and they made their way up the opposite slope, looking for drier ground. Part of the slope was in shadow, for the sun was sinking ahead of them, and Hazel, who wanted a warm, sunny spot, went on until they were quite near the lane. As they approached the gate he stopped, staring. </p>\n<p>“Fiver, what’s that? Look!” </p>\n<p>A little way in front of them, the ground had been freshly disturbed. Two piles of earth lay on the grass. Heavy posts, reeking of creosote and paint, towered up as high as the holly trees in the hedge, and the board they carried threw a long shadow across the top of the field. Near one of the posts, a hammer and a few nails had been left behind. </p>\n<p>The two rabbits went up to the board at a hopping run and crouched in a patch of nettles on the far side, wrinkling their noses at the smell of a dead cigarette end somewhere in the grass. Suddenly Fiver shivered and cowered down. </p>\n<p>“Oh, Hazel! This is where it comes from! I know now—something very bad! Some terrible thing—coming closer and closer.” </p>\n<p>He began to whimper with fear. </p>\n<p>“What sort of thing—what do you mean? I thought you said there was no danger?” </p>\n<p>“I don’t know what it is,” answered Fiver wretchedly. “There isn’t any danger here, at this moment. But it’s coming—it’s coming. Oh, Hazel, look! The field! It’s covered with blood!” </p>\n<p>“Don’t be silly, it’s only the light of the sunset. Fiver, come on, don’t talk like this, you’re frightening me!” </p>\n<p>Fiver sat trembling and crying among the nettles as Hazel tried to reassure him and to find out what it could be that had suddenly driven him beside himself. If he was terrified, why did he not run for safety, as any sensible rabbit would? But Fiver could not explain and only grew more and more distressed. At last Hazel said, </p>\n<p>“Fiver, you can’t sit crying here. Anyway, it’s getting dark. We’d better go back to the burrow.” </p>\n<p>“Back to the burrow?” whimpered Fiver. “It’ll come there—don’t think it won’t! I tell you, the field’s full of blood—” </p>\n<p>“Now stop it,” said Hazel firmly. “Just let me look after you for a bit. Whatever the trouble is, it’s time we got back.” </p>\n<p>He ran down the field and over the brook to the cattle wade. Here there was a delay, for Fiver—surrounded on all sides by the quiet summer evening—became helpless and almost paralyzed with fear. When at last Hazel had got him back to the ditch, he refused at first to go underground and Hazel had almost to push him down the hole. </p>\n<p>The sun set behind the opposite slope. The wind turned colder, with a scatter of rain, and in less than an hour it was dark. All color had faded from the sky: and although the big board by the gate creaked slightly in the night wind (as though to insist that it had not disappeared in the darkness, but was still firmly where it had been put), there was no passer-by to read the sharp, hard letters that cut straight as black knives across its white surface. They said: </p>\n<p>THIS IDEALLY SITUATED ESTATE, COMPRISING SIX ACRES OF EXCELLENT BUILDING LAND, IS TO BE DEVELOPED WITH HIGH CLASS MODERN RESIDENCES BY SUTCH AND MARTIN, LIMITED, OF NEWBURY, BERKS. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rabbits can count up to four. Any number above four is hrair—“a lot,” or “a thousand.” Thus they say U Hrair —“The Thousand”—to mean, collectively, all the enemies (or elil, as they call them) of rabbits—fox, stoat, weasel, cat, owl, man, etc. There were probably more than five rabbits in the litter when Fiver was born, but his name, Hrairoo, means “Little Thousand”—i.e., the little one of a lot or, as they say of pigs, “the runt.” </li></ul>\n<p>† Nearly all warrens have an Owsla, or group of strong or clever rabbits—second-year or older—surrounding the Chief Rabbit and his doe and exercising authority. Owslas vary. In one warren, the Owsla may be the band of a warlord: in another, it may consist largely of clever patrollers or garden-raiders. Sometimes a good storyteller may find a place; or a seer, or intuitive rabbit. In the Sandleford warren at this time, the Owsla was rather military in character (though, as will be seen later, not so military as some).</p></div>",

(Storygraph)</em><br><br><strong>The exhilarating dystopian novel that inspired George Orwell's</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic\">1984</span> <strong>and foreshadowed the worst excesses of Soviet Russia, featuring a foreword by the National Book Award-winning</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic\">New Yorker</span> <strong>journalist Masha Gessen<br><br></strong>Yevgeny Zamyatin's <em>We</em> is a powerfully inventive vision that has influenced writers from George Orwell to Ayn Rand. <br><br>In a glass-enclosed city of absolute straight lines, ruled over by the all-powerful 'Benefactor', the citizens of the totalitarian society of OneState live out lives devoid of passion and creativity - until D-503, a mathematician who dreams in numbers, makes a discovery: he has an individual soul. Set in the twenty-sixth century AD, <em>We</em> is the classic dystopian novel and was the forerunner of works such as George Orwell's <em>1984</em> and Aldous Huxley's <em>Brave New World</em>. It was suppressed for many years in Russia and remains a resounding cry for individual freedom, yet is also a powerful, exciting and vivid work of science fiction. Clarence Brown's brilliant translation is based on the corrected text of the novel, first published in Russia in 1988 after more than sixty years' suppression.<br><br><strong style=\"font-size: large\">Reviews<br><br></strong>“Zamyatin . . . did more than predict some of the specific characteristics of totalitarianism―he predicted its defining condition: the destruction of the individual. . . . [He] found the word for it: <em>We</em>.” ― <strong>Masha Gessen, from the Foreword<br><br></strong>“The best single work of science fiction yet written.” — <strong>Ursula K. Le Guin<br><br></strong>“[Zamyatin’s] intuitive grasp of the irrational side of totalitarianism—human sacrifice, cruelty as an end in itself—makes [ <em>We</em> ] superior to Huxley’s [ <em>Brave New World</em> ].” — <strong>George Orwell<br><br></strong>“At this dystopian moment in world politics, everyone’s talking about <em>1984</em> , but take a look at the novel that inspired it (or, at least, which George Orwell reviewed soon before he wrote <em>1984</em> )—Yevgeny Zamyatin’s <em>We.</em> . . . The dystopia Zamyatin painted has, alas, many echoes with today’s surveillance society—just think of China’s budding ‘social credit’ program, which monitors citizens’ movements. Big Brother was a piker, compared to Xi Jinping. Zamyatin saw it coming.” —Lit Hub<br><br><strong style=\"font-size: large\">About the Author<br><br></strong><strong>Yevgeny Zamyatin</strong> (1884-1937) was a naval architect by profession and a writer by nature. His favorite idea was the absolute freedom of the human personality to create, to imagine, to love, to make mistakes, and to change the world. This made him a highly inconvenient citizen of two despotisms, the tsarist and the Communist, both of which exiled him—the first for a year, the latter forever. He wrote short stories, plays, and essays, but his masterpiece is <em>We</em> , written in 1920–21 and soon thereafter translated into most of the languages of the world, yet it first appeared in Russia only in 1988. It is the archetype of the modern dystopia, or anti-utopia; a great prose poem on the fate that might befall all of us if we surrender our individual selves to some collective dream of technology and fail in the vigilance that is the price of freedom. George Orwell, the author of <em>1984</em> , acknowledged his debt to Zamyatin. The other great English dystopia of our time, Aldous Huxley’s <em>Brave New World</em> , was evidently written out of the same impulse, though without direct knowledge of Zamyatin’s <em>We</em>. <br><br><strong>Clarence Brown</strong> (translator/introducer; 1929-2015) was the editor of <em>The Portable Twentieth-Century Russian Reader</em> , which contains his translation of Zamyatin's short story \"The Cave.\" <br><br><strong>Masha Gessen</strong> (foreword) is the author of more than ten books, including the National Book Award-winning <em>The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia</em> and <em>The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin</em>. A staff writer at <em>The New Yorker</em> and the recipient of numerous awards, including Guggenheim and Carnegie fellowships, Gessen teaches at Bard College and lives in New York City.</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>\n<p>A number of fictional attempts have been made to portray what might lead a teenager to kill a number of schoolmates or teachers, Columbine style, but Shriver's is the most triumphantly accomplished by far. A gifted journalist as well as the author of seven novels, she brings to her story a keen understanding of the intricacies of marital and parental relationships as well as a narrative pace that is both compelling and thoughtful. Eva Khatchadourian is a smart, skeptical New Yorker whose impulsive marriage to Franklin, a much more conventional person, bears fruit, to her surprise and confessed disquiet, in baby Kevin. From the start Eva is ambivalent about him, never sure if she really wanted a child, and he is balefully hostile toward her; only good-old-boy Franklin, hoping for the best, manages to overlook his son's faults as he grows older, a largely silent, cynical, often malevolent child. The later birth of a sister who is his opposite in every way, deeply affectionate and fragile, does nothing to help, and Eva always suspects his role in an accident that befalls little Celia. The narrative, which leads with quickening and horrifying inevitability to the moment when Kevin massacres seven of his schoolmates and a teacher at his upstate New York high school, is told as a series of letters from Eva to an apparently estranged Franklin, after Kevin has been put in a prison for juvenile offenders. This seems a gimmicky way to tell the story, but is in fact surprisingly effective in its picture of an affectionate couple who are poles apart, and enables Shriver to pull off a huge and crushing shock far into her tale. It's a harrowing, psychologically astute, sometimes even darkly humorous novel, with a clear-eyed, hard-won ending and a tough-minded sense of the difficult, often painful human enterprise.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p>\n<h3>From Booklist</h3>\n<p><em>Starred Review</em> In a series of brutally introspective missives to her husband, Franklin, from whom she is separated, Eva tries to come to grips with the fact that their 17-year-old son, Kevin, has killed seven students and two adults... Guiltily she recalls how, as a successful writer, she was terrified of having a child. Was it for revenge, then, that from the moment of his birth Kevin was the archetypal difficult child, screaming for hours, refusing to nurse, driving away countless nannies, and intuitively learning to \"divide and conquer\" his parents? When their daughter, loving and patient Celia, is born, Eva feels vindicated; but as the gap between her view of Kevin as a \"Machiavellian miscreant\" and Franklin's efforts to explain away their son's aberrant behavior grows wider, they find themselves facing divorce. In crisply crafted sentences that cut to the bone of her feelings about motherhood, career, family, and what it is about American culture that produces child killers, Shriver yanks the reader back and forth between blame and empathy, retribution and forgiveness. Never letting up on the tension, Shriver ensures that, like Eva, the reader grapples with unhealed wounds. <em>Deborah Donovan</em><br><em>Copyright © American Library Association.

All rights reserved.</h3>\n<p>1  </p>\n<p>Yejide  </p>\n<p>“First thing you have to remember,” Granny Catherine hold her granddaughter, Yejide, close on her lap, “is that there was a time before time.” She press the first layer of tobacco down into the ebony bowl. The flame from her silver lighter make a small blaze in the cavern of the bowl and the pipe settle between her lips. “Before we come to live in this house, before the settlement in the valley, before the quarries, when the forest was so thick that no man could cross it, Morne Marie was the home only of animals. But not like animals we see now, oh no!” Catherine open her eyes wide and the blue smoke curl out of her nostrils. “The ocelots was big like tigers, the deer run so fast that no man could catch them even if he dare enter the forest to hunt them, and the little green parrots that sing at dusk was as big as the ​­blood-​­red ibis that live in the swamplands. The animals could talk to each other, just like I talking now, and they build a mighty city in the forest. But this city was nothing like Port Angeles. It had no buildings, no boundaries, no gates, and the animals live together without territory to guard and borders to mind.  </p>\n<p>“But one day a warrior wander into the forest. He see that it full of animals to hunt and fruit to eat. When he look at the trees he only see the houses he could build, and when he look at the land he only see what he could take. The animals try to talk to him and tell him that there was so much more there than what he could see, but he did not know their language and so could not understand them.  </p>\n<p>“That warrior bring more warriors and with the warriors come builders and with the builders come farmers and with the farmers come priests. With the priests come governors and with the governors come death.”  </p>\n<p>“But the animals fight them, right?” Yejide squirm on her granny lap. Nothing she love more than this ​­full-​­cupboard feeling: the sweet smell of tobacco, the even rhythm of the rocking chair, the green hills and her granny face brimming with story. She think of the sharp teeth of the ocelots and the tight grip of the macajuel that could suffocate a man in its coils; no way any human with just two legs, very small teeth and no poison at all could ever defeat the wild animals of the forest.  </p>\n<p>Catherine look at her and puff on her pipe. “Who telling the story, you or me?”  </p>\n<p>Yejide grin and quiet down again.  </p>\n<p>“The animals had always live in peace, but they know then that it was time for war. The battle rage bloody and terrible. The quarry you see there”—​Catherine point out the window to the deep brown crater on the ​­hillside—“was where the animals make a stand in a battle so fierce that it leave scars on the mountain.  </p>\n<p>“All that killing cut the forest deep. Wounded, it went into mourning and that bring the longest dry season ever on Morne Marie. The rivers hide in the earth and the trees wilt and die away. The ocelots shrink small like house cats, the howler monkeys get timid, and the deer and manicou and lappe, who had live in peace before, start to look at each other and see food. The warriors suffer too, for no one, man nor animal, could survive when nature decide to withhold its bounty.  </p>\n<p>“Then one day when all were weary, and it look like the war would claim not only the fighters but the whole forest, a great storm set up in the hills. Fat, grey clouds empty out into the green and the men and animals rejoice to see the rivers rise again, and the forest drink deep of the rain. Thunder and lightning pelt down for three days and three nights. But remember I tell you, this was a time before time, when a tree could reach ​­full-​­grown in a day and a boy could reach manhood in a night, so this storm was longer and fiercer than any of the animals had ever see before. The earth slide down the hillsides and crash into the valley below. Trees older than any animal could remember lose their hold on the earth and topple over. The rivers burst their banks and rush over the land. Rejoicing turn again to sorrow. It come like the whole forest turn on them and demand its share of the lives who defile its sacred places with war.  </p>\n<p>“Now, the green parrots, the ones who still cackle and sing and chatter, just like you”—​Catherine pinch Yejide’s lips together to stop her from ​­giggling—“well, they were wiser than any of the animals give them credit for. The parrots watch the rain and watch the hills and watch the rivers and watch the dead pile high. They gather together in the branches of the last sacred silk cotton tree and hold a council. At the council’s end, the parrot battalion split and divide in two. One half fly to the east and the other half fly to the west.  </p>\n<p>“The parrots that went west became the little green birds we see today, those that sing and fly toward the setting of the sun. But those that went east toward the sunrise mute their green feathers to black and curve their beaks into sharp hooks. Their bodies get fat and their wingspan stretch so wide they darken the land below them as they fly. They release one last great song that make all the animals and men tremble, then grow grey hoods around their heads and necks that silence their throats forever.  </p>\n<p>“You know what they turn into, Yejide?” Catherine stare out the window, smile and puff on her pipe.  </p>\n<p>“Corbeaux!” Yejide cry out. She love getting the right answer. No matter how many times she hear the story, knowing the answer always make her feel grown up and very important.  </p>\n<p>Catherine nod and pull deep from the pipe. “When the change was complete, they feel their bellies get hungry for flesh. They spread their wings wide and circle the land slow, searching out the dead. And with their new long, curved beaks and talons sharp like caiman teeth, they tear into the flesh of the animals who was once their friends and the men who was once their enemies. When they done, they take to the silk cotton tree again, leaving nothing but bone.  </p>\n<p>“The living look on in horror to see the devouring of the dead. They don’t understand how the birds they once knew could do something so terrible. But the chattering parrots they knew were gone. They turn into something else entirely now. When they shed their green and change their form, they take on a sacred ​­duty—​to stand at the border between the living and the dead. So they wait for the dying and watch over the carcasses and consume the flesh. And no one but the corbeaux know that inside their bodies the souls of the dead transform and release.”  </p>\n<p>Catherine lift Yejide off her lap and put her to stand on the wooden floor in her white ​­patent-​­leather church shoes. “Right. Story done. Now make sure and put those shoes away. And your nice dress. Hang it on the back of the chair in my room. Don’t let me come and find that you just leave it anyhow.”  </p>\n<p>But Yejide know the ritual well. “Story not done, Granny. What happen next?”  </p>\n<p>Catherine look down at her granddaughter. Just now she would be too tall for ​­little-​­girl dresses, too grown to sit on her lap. But not ​­yet—​she reach her hand out and Yejide run back into her arms. Not yet.  </p>\n<p>“Well, when the sun rise on the fourth morning of the great storm, when all the corbeaux stomach full and everyone weary with pain and grief, the rain stop. No more flood. Balance come back to the forest. But after they get saved, nobody like to think of who rescue them. In this way people and animals are the same. Everyone begin to fear the corbeaux. So, they fly away to live at the edges of the forest of Morne Marie. They alone know the world changing and it would have work for them in the cities of men to come. And so, like in all the stories that change the world, over time everyone forget that the ending of the storm happen at the same time the corbeaux born. Everyone, of course, except the ​­corbeaux—” She bend close to whisper in Yejide’s ear. “We remember.”</p>",

Ideal if you like brisk yet reflective nonfiction that blends historical data, feminist critique, and wry humor, preferring provocative ideas over dense theory or academic jargon.</em><br><br><strong>A spirited, deeply researched exploration of why capitalism is bad for women and how, when done right, socialism leads to economic independence, better labor conditions, better work-life balance and, yes, even better sex.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong>In a witty, irreverent op-ed piece that went viral, Kristen Ghodsee argued that women had better sex under socialism. The response was tremendous — clearly she articulated something many women had sensed for years: the problem is with capitalism, not with us.<br>Ghodsee, an acclaimed ethnographer and professor of Russian and East European Studies, spent years researching what happened to women in countries that transitioned from state socialism to capitalism. She argues here that unregulated capitalism disproportionately harms women, and that we should learn from the past.
